# National Cemetery Administration

**VA maintains:**
- 139 national cemeteries in 40 states (and Puerto Rico) as well as 
- 33 soldier’s lots
- monument sites 
- Nationwide Gravesite Locator  
  - allows "search for burial locations of veterans and their family members in VA National Cemeteries, state veterans cemeteries, various other military and Department of Interior cemeteries, and for veterans buried in private cemeteries when the grave is marked with a government grave marker"
  - "The Nationwide Gravesite Locator includes burial records from many sources. These sources provide varied data; some searches may contain less information than others. Information on veterans buried in private cemeteries was collected for the purpose of furnishing government grave markers, and we do not have information available for burials prior to 1997."

- U.S. Soldiers’ & Airmen’s Home National Cemetery 
- 39 Army National Military Cemeteries

Urban initiative:  to establish new columbaria-only national cemeteries to enhance service in urban areas where distance and travel time from the center of the city (urban
core) to an existing national cemetery present barriers to visitation and contribute to lower usage rates than national cemeteries in other large, urban areas.

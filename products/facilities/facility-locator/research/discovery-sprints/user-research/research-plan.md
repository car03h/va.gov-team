# (WIP) Research Plan for Facility Locator, October 2019

## Goals
This research plan is for the Facility Locator Tool on VA.gov - VSA Facility Locator team.

The Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA.

Our objective for this research is to learn the current user behavior on Facility Locator and to identify areas of improvement, including the following areas:
- Facility/Service/Provider information & hierarchy
- Understanding of different VA facilities and services
- Language and classification of facilities 
- Overall usability of the tool
- Overlap with other tools on VA.gov
- Error treatment and language
- Communication of physical characteristics of facility (drive-time, accessible entrances, etc.)

#### Research questions:
- How easy/difficult is it for a user to find a facility?
- What ways do users navigate to the facility locator?
- What search criteria should be present so that Veterans can find facilities?
_ What information do Veterans expect to see in the search results?
- Do Veterans understand what the different facility classifications mean?
- How do Veterans distinguish emergency, urgent, and community care facilities?
- What other tools/sites do vets use to find facilities or services?

#### Hypothesis: 
Our hypothesis is that veterans and caretakers will primarily search for specific services that are provided by VA facilities instead of directly searching for facilities. They will most likely filter locations near them by a specific service they are requesting. They may not know the exact differences between emergemcy, urgent, and community care facilities. 

## Method
Remoted Moderated Usability Testing will help us gain a first-hand view of how veterans and caretakers use the facility locator tool. We will watch for trends in behavior, workflow, and interactions with content. 

We will be testing the current [VA.gov Facility Locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations) through Zoom.

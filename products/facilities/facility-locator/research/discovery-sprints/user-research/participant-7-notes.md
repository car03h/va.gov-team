# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 7
## 10/30/2019	1pm – 2pm
## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

I am on a company asset, and am not authorized to let an external entity view my computer (there is no guarantee that my files are protected)
is this a problem for the study?


**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?**
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?
- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose to go to it?
- Is there anything you wish you would have known about the location before your visit?

Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov? 
[If yes] What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?
[If no] How could a facility locator be helpful to you on VA.gov?

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?


only infrequently for information as I do not use the VA for healthcare
looking for info on finding facilities before

can you remember the last time you did that?
not doing the full session, won't be the usual 30 minutes
if you need to stop
can I record the audio? yes
verifying on record
I am ok recording

When did you use it
I'm on the webpage right now. I'm using the location finder
On the mapI'ms seeing different icons which I ghuess correspons ot differenst services at the facilities
There are many in my area
At first glnce it's clear that some are medical centers
cemeteries are clear too
I have to guess at what the other icons are
I don't see a key or anything 

How did you get to the location finder
well, at the header of the website, there are two drop down menus and find a va location
I clicked on the header

when you clicked on that, did you allow your locatio from the browse
no, typed it
lookin at the map first and the icons there
immed I typed in the zip code for reference and search all sfacilities, default and then search

Now I see that if I had gon to the drop down, there is a key for th esymbols in the map. thats the only place thati am seeing that
If I sdo wjust what I did, it's the fastest, and then zoom to narrow down the choices

I eant ot stp back and ask about that last time you civisted a physical location and what that experience waslike

I cannot recall

\That's fine

So using this website are you more incluined to use th emap or list and why
I think ordinarei us et he map since I am an urban env so transportation is first convern...convenience and prox
Second if I was loking for a specific service I would search by (...)
I thought is owuld be by service I would pull that out

for the sake of this conversation, medical need...

How ouwl dyou chooise one?
sure if I needed a medical facility, I would just either look at proximity and then on the map I wpuould click on 
I trie to click
you find the bugg
Backed me already out
Map is gone
refresh the page

Gotcha. that's ordinateily, drag and drop since that didn't work
Use the drop down, VA health, search, I hget the other options, it provides the phone numbers I assume calling the hotline would allow me to learn which opnes whill serve my needs
Which page are you one
VA find location page
I would prefer to use the dropdown for everything...dental services...narrow it down
Chose one of the locations 
ok
where on the screen did you click.the map...it actually pulled it up
Are you on the page for that now? It just gave me the buble to what it is linked to it defined it as (PII), gave it the address, number
Right before that...the info ton hte lie?
What else did you need to see to have enough info

Um...since I went to the granular level of dental services..maybe if dental services had a direct nmumber or hours. Like if I had an urgent dental need, ...street brwawl...knocked out my
process of eleiminations to get more info...not ideal with my front teth knocked out
yes/no urgent dental...hour (...)

ok, click into that

if you are on the page with more details about that clinic? yes
gives approximate wait times
feedback onhelpful to see, anything tmissing about deals

well, for some reason in the drop down menuo nthe find location
I specified dental services and this location popped up but when I chose this location, there is no mention of dental services. That's a loittle bit less helpful
As for, let's see, the wait times are pretty helpful. Maybe putting those , extrat that data on the find the locatin at all. I eel that would be a big determining factor, if they have choices, in an urnan environemnt. is thiere a way to put a way to should wait times in a little bubble, if I'm looking in a certain zip code, cardiology, it shows me three options for medical centers, if that could pop up in each location, pulled out for that speciality...if I could see on the birds eye view so I know which one to call first, prioritizing those  (...)

are you still on that detail page fo the loation?
At the top right, there's view on map...opinion

ok. That's; helpful it just shows the route but the particular interface I'm using (ms edge) there is no hyperlink , the view is zoomed in and shows the intersection I would probably use iphone or google to type in the address, I don't think it's necessarily to invest in that, I can't use it to navigate

all the questions I had for you on those few screens 
Planning a trip to this locaiton

Not that I can think of. I'm not your best candidate since I don't use va health care. I have plenty of freiends with lots of opinins, 

I apprecaite you chatting with me

1-5 scale, how would you rate being able to ifnd

finding a location on this website, I'd say a four
why a four?
based on the I had to spend a few minutes getting familiar with the webspage before I knoew what information to give it. my initial confusion was knowing what the icons meant, the only 

the default is search for facilitie sbut searching for allf acilities doesn't show all icons 
(...
0 need to use that drop down 
maybe ia banner in the header at that eye line to showcase the icons you are about to see , not literlaly titling ithat but ind va locations and next to it and the bubble ivons in the line, in a row then people are familiar, I' don't know what those mean, let me knfind out. I didn't know what I was going to get ingo

Different beteween

urgent care could be um, for nonemergency situationwwoithout appt
emergency care, hopefully peopl eare using only in emergency and not to jump the line for regualr care
I don't know what family care
community care
still don't know what that means.

Apprecaite that. no problem I'm glad that I was able to help
Of course. That's all I've got. I appreciate yoru feedback

I know there are plenty of people who use

one testifies on the hill against the va
another one is out of the country on assignements




## Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?  
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit
[If still on search results]

Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

[Follow up if they didn't choose "Find VA Locations" in header] Will you return to the homepage? Let's say you don't have a medical situation, but need to visit a VA facility for another reason, how would you do that from this page?

## Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?
- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?
- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 7
## 10/30/2019	1pm – 2pm
## Introduction - 5 min

*From the Zoom chat: I am on a company asset, and am not authorized to let an external entity view my computer (there is no guarantee that my files are protected) is this a problem for the study?*
 - As a result, the decision was made to not screen share but to conoduct the interview verbally only. The Participant gave consent to record the audio. 

## Background - 5 min

**Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov?**
*Response: Only infrequently for information as I do not use the VA for healthcare. Probably looking for info on finding facilities before. 

**Can you remember the last time you did that? Actually, let me back up. I apologize for jumping right in...(...)
Since we're not doing the full session, this won't be the usual 30 minutes. We want to hear your honest opinions. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? It will be deleted after the notes are completed.**
*Response: yes*
**And just to verify on record, are you ok with me recording the audio?**
*Response: I am ok recording.*

**When did you use VA.gov?**
*Response: I'm on the web page right now. I'm using the location finder.On the map I'm seeing different icons which I guess correspond to different services at the facilities.There are many facilities in my area. At first glance it's clear that some are medical centers.
Cemeteries are clear too. I have to guess at what the other icons are, I don't see a key or anything.* 

**How did you get to the location finder?**
*Response: well, at the header of the website, there are two drop down menus and 'find a va location'. I clicked on the header.*

**hen you clicked on that, did you allow your location from the browser?**
*Response: no, I typed it in. Looking at the map first and the icons there, immediately I typed in the zip code for reference and searched all facilities, as the default and then search. (....) Now I see that if I had gone to the drop down, there is a key for the symbols in the map. That's the only place that I am seeing that information. So, if I do just what I did, it's the fastest, and then zoom to narrow down the choices (...)*

**I want to step back and ask about that last time you visited a physical location and what that experience was like.**
*Response: I cannot recall.*
**That's fine. So using this website, are you more incluined to use the map or list and why?**
*Response:I think ordinarily I would use the map since I am in an urban environment so transportation is my first concern, like convenience and proximity. Second if I was looking for a specific service I would search by (...) I thought is would be by service I would pull that out (...)*

**For the sake of this conversation, imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, how would you choose one?**
*Response: Sure if I needed a medical facility, I would just either look at proximity and then on the map I would click on... I tried to click...*
**You found the bug.**
*Response: It backed me all the way out. The map is gone.*
**Refresh the page.**
*Response: Gotcha. That's ordinarily what I'd try to do, drag and drop. Since that didn't work
Use the drop down, VA health, search, I hget the other options, it provides the phone numbers I assume calling the hotline would allow me to learn which opnes whill serve my needs
Which page are you one
VA find location page
I would prefer to use the dropdown for everything...dental services...narrow it down
Chose one of the locations 
ok
where on the screen did you click.the map...it actually pulled it up
Are you on the page for that now? It just gave me the buble to what it is linked to it defined it as (PII), gave it the address, number
Right before that...the info ton hte lie?
What else did you need to see to have enough info

Um...since I went to the granular level of dental services..maybe if dental services had a direct nmumber or hours. Like if I had an urgent dental need, ...street brwawl...knocked out my
process of eleiminations to get more info...not ideal with my front teth knocked out
yes/no urgent dental...hour (...)

ok, click into that

if you are on the page with more details about that clinic? yes
gives approximate wait times
feedback onhelpful to see, anything tmissing about deals

well, for some reason in the drop down menuo nthe find location
I specified dental services and this location popped up but when I chose this location, there is no mention of dental services. That's a loittle bit less helpful
As for, let's see, the wait times are pretty helpful. Maybe putting those , extrat that data on the find the locatin at all. I eel that would be a big determining factor, if they have choices, in an urnan environemnt. is thiere a way to put a way to should wait times in a little bubble, if I'm looking in a certain zip code, cardiology, it shows me three options for medical centers, if that could pop up in each location, pulled out for that speciality...if I could see on the birds eye view so I know which one to call first, prioritizing those  (...)

are you still on that detail page fo the loation?
At the top right, there's view on map...opinion

ok. That's; helpful it just shows the route but the particular interface I'm using (ms edge) there is no hyperlink , the view is zoomed in and shows the intersection I would probably use iphone or google to type in the address, I don't think it's necessarily to invest in that, I can't use it to navigate

all the questions I had for you on those few screens 
Planning a trip to this locaiton

Not that I can think of. I'm not your best candidate since I don't use va health care. I have plenty of freiends with lots of opinins, 

I apprecaite you chatting with me

1-5 scale, how would you rate being able to ifnd

finding a location on this website, I'd say a four
why a four?
based on the I had to spend a few minutes getting familiar with the webspage before I knoew what information to give it. my initial confusion was knowing what the icons meant, the only 

the default is search for facilitie sbut searching for allf acilities doesn't show all icons 
(...
0 need to use that drop down 
maybe ia banner in the header at that eye line to showcase the icons you are about to see , not literlaly titling ithat but ind va locations and next to it and the bubble ivons in the line, in a row then people are familiar, I' don't know what those mean, let me knfind out. I didn't know what I was going to get ingo

Different beteween

urgent care could be um, for nonemergency situationwwoithout appt
emergency care, hopefully peopl eare using only in emergency and not to jump the line for regualr care
I don't know what family care
community care
still don't know what that means.

Apprecaite that. no problem I'm glad that I was able to help
Of course. That's all I've got. I appreciate yoru feedback

I know there are plenty of people who use

one testifies on the hill against the va
another one is out of the country on assignements




## Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?  
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit
[If still on search results]

Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

[Follow up if they didn't choose "Find VA Locations" in header] Will you return to the homepage? Let's say you don't have a medical situation, but need to visit a VA facility for another reason, how would you do that from this page?

## Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?
- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?
- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.

## Closing - 5 min
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 thank-you gift. Is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address Shannon and Brian used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? [If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, we can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

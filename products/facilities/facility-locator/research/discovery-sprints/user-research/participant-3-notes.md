# Participant 3	
## 10/28/2019	2pm – 3pm	


## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Moderator:** Will you be comfortable with recording?
**Participant:** Yes I’m fine


**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

**Moderator:** Let me hit the record. Let me confirm: Are you be comfortable with recording?
**Participant:** Yes I am

## Background - 5 min

Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly? 
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?
- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose to go to it?


**Moderator:** Thanks for taking some time to chat today I’d love to get a little bit of background on a recent time that that you’ve visited a VA facility
**Participant:** Ok want me to explain it now?  
**Participant:** Visited a facility and not the site?
**Moderator:** Yes the physical location
**Participant:** Visited for an appointment with a psychiatrist. Checked in. Waited a bit. Doctor came out met him came out he was very good renewed the prescription
**Moderator:** What kind of facility was it?
**Participant:** Medical center
**Moderator:** OK how did you learn about that specific location
**Participant:** I don’t remember because I was in Minneapolis and that the main location


Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov? 
[If yes] What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?
[If no] How could a facility locator be helpful to you on VA.gov?

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

**Moderator:** I’m going as you to to share and I just put in the zoom chat and when it loads I’ll ask you to share your screen and we’ll talk a little bit about the share
**Participant:** Where does it say to share screen?
**Moderator:** There down the bottom
**Participant:** Select the window that you want to share…Select the window that you want to share…Not working yet?
**Moderator:** No I’m not seeing anything. It might ask to validate or choose the screen you want to share
**Participant:** No this is not the one. Now you have it?


## Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

**Moderator:** Awesome thank you. I’m going to ask you a few questions about this website in particular. Sorry my dog started snoring super loud. Speak out loud think out loud. Give any feedback along the way. I’m going to give you as specific scenario
**Moderator:** Let’s imaging you have a specific medical condition that you had to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?
*<Participant Selects “Schedule and view your appointments” under Health Care Block.>*
**Moderator:** Talk with me why you would choose that 
**Participant:** Choose between healthcare disability education records it seem s to be the most applicable to go see something. 
**Moderator:** Awesome so from this page what would you do to research or find a facility or location?
**Participant:** To find a facility or location…
**Moderator:** Feel free to scroll up and down and review different information on the screen. Be sure to talk me through anything and thoughts
**Participant:** It seems like it would have to be immediately something that would say VA healthcare
**Participant:** No I’m on a different page now.
**Participant:** Uhh
*user is scrolling.*
**Participant:** I’m going to go back to the schedule and view appointments which is where it was 
**Participant: Here I see how do I talk to someone right now it seems like it you be a little more obvious
**Participant:** “Contact your health”
**Participant:** “Locate and contact your facility”
**Participant:** OK


### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?  
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

**Moderator:** Locate your healthcare facility or clinic. Um yeah to locate and contact your clinic looks like we’ve landed on the Find VA location page. It looks like you accepted the location there. How would you use the map to locate you would need to 
**Participant:** I’m actually registered in several different facilities.
**Participant:** I don’t live in Saint Cloud right now I live in Minneapolis. 
**Participant:** Looks like I would have to switch over and look for my local one
<participant inputs zip code>
**Participant:** At least I found the local number and the mental health number
**Moderator:** So talk me through a little bit I noticed that you went to the list first. I’m interested to know how you think the map be helpful for you.
**Participant:** If I zoom it I would have to zoom in a little bit I know that this is the main facility here
**Participant:** That’s not the right now.
**Moderator:** Let’s look at the information on the left. Is there anything else on the list that would help you determine which one you wanted to visit.
**Participant:** VA Medical Center is going to be the most likely. 
**Participant:** The most likely one the largest one should be at the top
**Participant:** The main medical center can be easily overlooked but if I click on this it still comes up as the 
**Participant:** The main facility doesn’t show up on this map. OK I can’t quite find the location. It should be on highway 55. Ah right here it should be somewhere along here. Here’s the main one right here it doesn’t show up as the most obvious choice. 


### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit
[If still on search results]

Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

**Moderator:** You mentioned that it should be the first one listed but not. If you can go ahead and click on that one. If you could just scroll up and down the screen and whether it would be helpful to see or if anything is mission. 
**Participant:** The map is helpful and the phone number and the mental health number the website is belpful. Either delete or populate the hours of operation. This is all current this is all right <referring to services> This is good information new patient wait times. Dermatology this is all very good I never knew this was available.
**Participant:** So yea there is some good information for the quality of care satisfaction what they offer specialties but I would probably go to the specific website for that facility this is the one I’m familiar with. <proceeds to go to Minneapolis VA Health Care System website>
**Participant:** Probably go to appointments schedule a VA appointment. If you are a facility this doesn’t tell me this accepts online appointments. Should tell that this facility accepts or does not accept online appointments.
**Participant:** Cancel appointments.
**Participant:** I do know you call the main number 
**Participant:** The main number should be on here scheduling a VA appointment. And I don’t even see instructions on how to make an appointment by phone.
**Moderator:** Is that how you call?

**Participant:** I call the main number 725-2000
**Moderator:** Is there any information about the physical location that you would want to see to help you plan your visits ahead of time?
**Participant:** Here it has directions and covers there. And along here this is enough information there is locations and directions health care providers. Some of this is really good. 
**Participant:** Something here would be “make an appointment” or “schedule a VA appointment”.
**Participant:** To schedule a VA appointment it should be right here and by phone needs to be completed there’s not much information there. There should be a paragraph here. <referencing “By Phone” subheader on Appointments Page>
**Moderator:** Great I don’t have any more specifically about the website so you feel free to stop sharing your screen if you like


## Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?

**Moderator:** From a scale of 1 to 5 1 being extremely difficult how did you find 
**Participant:** A 3
**Moderator:** Why would you rate it a 3
**Participant:** It could be definitely easier to find maybe you can enter a search for a specialist—Dermatologist--you can see a dermatologist in your area. This is for only specific situations.
**Moderator:** OK that makes sense to me.


- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?

**Moderator:** Something that we didn’t talk about is there are a couple of different type VA facility Urgent care facility what is the difference between community care and urgent care
**Participant:** Emergency care is going to place in an ambulance or driving yourself.  Up toward the beginning. More obvious that the very beginning. Get to the nearest facility or get to so you mentioned that 


- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.

**Moderator:** Is there anything else you would need in order to see the facility 
**Participant:** I would say there’s something for urgent care or make an appointment there should be something on the main page when you go to see the facility.
**Moderator:** Do you have any questions for me?
**Participant:** Nope.

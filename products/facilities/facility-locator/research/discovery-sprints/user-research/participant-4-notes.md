# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 4
## 10/29/2019	1pm – 2pm	

## Introduction - 5 min

**Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. It will just be you and I talking today. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes or so.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. You won't hurt my feelings, we just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.**
- **If for any reason, you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** *Response:  Sure, no problem. I don't have anything to hide.*

## Background - 5 min
**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?**
*Response: ...specialty lab, remodeled the Little Rock facility...it was beutiful, nice. In the years, the wait times have gone way down for the most part. Seems more efificent , people are very nice, I'm really happy with that

Fayette

Do you remember how you chose that fac or how you

I already had my dis rating while I was in Denver. Moved 12 years ago, looked up the closest
Va.gov? Vet.gove
Yes
Is there anything specific that was helpful? Or wish you would 
If I remember right, it clicked, described the fac, how to get there, wasn't very complicated That was 12 years ago...don't remember more thatn that

I assme you found what you were lookinf for since you visited that fac .That's good
Fore sure



## Usability Test - 15 min
**I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. Be as vocal as you can.**


ok

Makebelieve scenario...I will ask you to use the website 
Mdical situation requires you to visit

Well, let's see here...looing at health cre first of all
I would schedule and view appointments
You seem a bit hesitatn, can you tell me 
You seemed very specific for something I needed right now
I would be thinking about urgent care, Mission act situation
If it was one of my specialty labs that I use 3-4 times/yr. I would use this schedule and view

Go ahead and click that if that is where you would go. From here. it sthere any inof on this page that owuld help you find a va location?

More resrouces, highlighted area, nothing here that I can see, going on down reading....find a location for the va facility for your appo
Where on the screen would you click
My cursor is on that...but...trying with my cursor ..let me try to click on it....let me keep going down. Nothing to click no there. Usually eanything you can click on is highlighted. Let me see. non-va providers is highlighted. I do not...let me go back up, I guess. Are you asking me to click on something to find a location?
Yes
I don't see anything to click on!
I don't see anything to click on to do that!
Scrol back oup to the top.
ok
If you are to lok at the top or how to talk to someone...is there aything 
There's a link to that. Should I click on it
Is there anything here that can help you find a locatio
There's a 8-00 number but that's criss
Very bottom , there is a find your nearest
That seems to be a weird way to get to that
Why do you think that
I'd expect that to be on the first page and not through to talk to somebody
Without you, I wouldn
t have found that 

Go ahead and click on fid a nearest medical center
Great

Selected allow

From here, scroll down just a little bit and look at that map
How would you choose the va that would would want to visit

Ok... well, how would I do it?
I would use the location necause of these satellite clinics, I was assigned a location several years ago/10 years ago...other too far, always gone there
Like Conway, it goes by my daughters
We're not near a big place/shopping center. We go by there

dEcent (...)

So are you looking at things surrounding that location
Because of everything ariund the location ,yes

Look at the list on the left of the locations near you
How would you use this list?

Look at it...first one is Conway...that's pretty easy. Is there any info to help you

Mileage, distance. There's one thing about va websites. They're not giving you road distance. It's crow flight distance
VA from my house...I remember....53 miles...here it lists 37 miles

I tried to argue with them before, due to travel pay and things...I \
You just can't go through that lake to get there
The searcy isn't that much father but it atakes a lot longer on the smaller road 

Would it be helpful for you to see some sort of variation on your trip on here

You mentioned you can't go through the lake

Somehting like  ampwuest...travel time not mileage whole lot better
Best route, fastest routhe

like on my phone


You can use the list or the map, choose the one

Clikc on it to vie the page detail

Clink on the little box like that

Scroll through this screen, talk me though thi

Conway where I want to be

Website nice
directions nice
What kind of directions
not the same mileage you know

List of all the services, which is excellent

upgrade since I use d it

appintments, really good
New patient wait times, meant for o ther folks but that's really good
existing patient wait times could really help if I had a ciutaiton medically that wasn't super eurgetn that I scould use my speciality or make a determination about going to urgent care

Ok, it does have urgent care appointment here.
Ok , this is all VA facilities, not jsut va facilities, that could actually be helpful

That's about what I see, aricka

There's a map up here on the top right is it hgelpful? If so

That little map, right here? That's absolutely waster space

Is there anything we could use that space or or add tinfo that owuld be helpful


If I were new, had no idea, it doesn't even show the main rioad to get there

East of sam's club, can see it from the interstate
I could see it from there
It would give you a point that most people know about

landmark or recognized

It's getting really developed

Drew bress sports bar 1.3 million dollars for 7 acres
up and ocming everything there

dennies 700K
that's bizarre, somepone has a racket

All new conway down there in the next 10 yers
that's good to know...landakr to signal 

It doens't even show the roundabout nexar sams club

The first time you go through those roundabouts, it freaks yu out

Anything else that would be 

I knlike the hours of operations
Phone number, netal heal

the wesbite a sa whole is quite nice, quite usable, except fo rthat tiny little map

I want to see the website...

interested to see what you think about it


conway...ok...directions driving directions...ok...starting address
driving directions as provided as a convenience
ok, let's do that again
ok
googe maps
and it does give us 1 hr 8 minutes, 52 miles and the va website is 37 miles....pretty big discrepancy when it comes to travel pay and I tried to agrue with them aboutt hat and didn't get anywhere

Aricka, it's not worth the effort. you're talking about the interwporkings of the va iw oudln't know who to talk to to get there

Misssion act, ugrgent care visit went fine
Pharmacy wasn't participating 
Pharmacy didn't know aything about it
sent it in 3  times, got it back 3 times now they wan to the leaflet that went with it, of course the first one I through away I went aoroung and round and round...passing me to different people, no one knew what to do about it 

Frustrating
It can be crazy

Go back to that first tab on the top left


1-5...
1 being difficult

how would you rate this?

I'd say it's a 4
Why a four
laid out quite clearly
all except for that one click we had to do...talk to somebody
Where in the worl d anm I going
click ing all over the webiste

this page is quite good

one more question


click the the va in the blue part of the screen


Interested to know

visit a loctioa nif it wasn't related to any medical situation, what would you click

A location? um

oh for crying out loud
I don't see anything immediately that jumps out at me at all
I've been concentrating on for box
oh...above them...find a va location

why do you think it was dificu\\

4 boxes grab my attention

we talked about urgetn care a little bit...difference


Urgen care more minor scale but not desparate

I just went the other day
Broke out like crazy
Shingles
I thought shingles was for old people

Weirdest part it's supposed to

1 hr 8 min to get to conway
still not anything close to me

on the va wesbite
2 urgent care, 21 pharmacies

I told you about the experience
pay out of pocket
trying to get reimbu

I called the five first pharmacies

All five had not heard of mission act and filling pre
for veterans

walmart...(bay) across th elake, cornestone, another in grovery, clinto n pahramcy

no one had every heard of it 

hlisted on line and then no one

toyou'd think maybe one or two buyt all 5??

disbursement of information i=to ocmmunity is lacking greatly

Appreciate your time
When it startts to get cold there, you keep it. 



They didn't know what to do
I accidentally came across 800 umber about 10 days later

It's to handle any issue related to mission act

Whay isn't that available on any ewebiste

You need access to that nphone number

That would hbe helpful?
Bvery much so!!

It's good to hear that it would be very helpful for ou to have that. 



### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
**Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?**

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning

**From a Scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate ease of use?**

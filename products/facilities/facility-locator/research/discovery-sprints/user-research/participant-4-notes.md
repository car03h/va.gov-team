# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 4
## 10/29/2019	1pm – 2pm	

## Introduction - 5 min

**Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. It will just be you and I talking today. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes or so.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. You won't hurt my feelings, we just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.**
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** *Response: I have no problem with that* 

**I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.** *Response: by all means, please.* **Thank you**

## Background - 5 min
**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?**

## Usability Test - 15 min
**I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. Be as vocal as you can.**

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
**Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?**

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning

**From a Scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate ease of use?**

# Facility Locator Discovery Research Findings WIP
November 2019

## Methodology
We conducted moderated user testing sessions with 7 participants, all Veterans, during the week of October 28 – November 1, 2019. The participants were recruited through the DSVA's recruitment contract with Perigean. Sessions were conducted and recorded via Zoom.

Transcripts and notes can all be found in the [Facility Locator Discovery Research folder.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/new/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/discovery-sprints/user-research)

## Summary
We found XX high-level trends regarding Veteran objective when using the tool and overall usability of the tool.

1. **Veterans search by a specific service and by distance when choosing a location to visit.** Description WIP
2. **Veterans need consistent information between online and physical locations** and are skeptical of information presented on VA.gov
3. **The map is useful when it is interactive** and when it shows landmarks relative to VA locations
4. **There is a need for multiple entry points to the Facility Locator tool.** Description TBD
5. **There is a need to see some location information at a higher level.** The location specific page is helpful when preparing a visit but 
6. **Separate workflows and acccess to location information creates confusion when trying to find a VA location.** Veterans have a general understanding of the difference between Urgent and Emergency care, but could not differentiate which facilities provided those services.

### Urgent Care Research
There was a usability study conducted in June 2019 that included finding urgent care locations. It can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/findings.md)

#### Findings from the Urgent Care research matched findings from this study including:
- Bugs with the interactive map
- Users assuming VA Hospitals were urgent care facilities
- No user used the "Find a VA Location" link in the site header for the urgent care use case. Home page pathways that users followed (from most used to least used) include:
  - Search - More than half of users
  - Health Care (clickable heading near the bottom of the page) - Some users
  - Contact Us (which does lead to the VA.gov location finder) - Few users
  - Find a VA health facility, benefit office, or cemetery (blue box in the lower left corner of the home page) - One user

#### The following findings from the Urgent Care study are helpful to the Facility Locator Discovery research:
- User expressed confusion at the "Service type" field changing from optional to required
- Users looked for "Urgent Care" in the drop down menu under "Search for"

#### Recommendations from the Urgent Care study that are relevant to Facility Locator:
- Moving “Find a VA Location” closer to “Search” and/or “Contact Us”
- Removing the location finder link from the navigation, and integrating it into the existing “Search” drop down similarly to how it has been integrated into the “Contact Us” drop down.

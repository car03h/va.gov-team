# Conversation Guide for Facility Locator Discovery
## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly? 
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emercency, etc)?
- Why did you choose to go to that facility?
- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose that one?

Are you familiar with the Find VA Locations tool on VA.gov? **(share link)**

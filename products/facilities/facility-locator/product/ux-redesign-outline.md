# _Facility Locator UX Redesign_

## Table of Contents
The UX redesign will have two main areas of focus
- [Overall usability and search functionality](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/product/ux-redesign-outline.md#overall-usability-and-search-functionality-mvp)
- [Urgent/emergency care](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/product/ux-redesign-outline.md#urgent-care)

## Overall usability and search functionality (MVP)

### User Journey
- Veterans and beneficiaries need a single, consolidated place across VA.gov to easily find and understand high-level information about facilities offering priority VA benefits and services (WIP) 

### Problem
*What problems are we trying to solve or user pain points we’re seeking to alleviate?*
- Search UI is inconsistent (i.e., free text search box, dropdowns, typeahead)
- Map functionality is confusing (iconography, results, mileage)
- Search parameters for facility type/service is not consistent with Veterans' mental models about care.

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran, I want reliable and consistent information between online and physical locations so that I can trust the information which is displayed. 
- As a Veteran, I need multiple entry points to the Facility Locator tool so that I can search for a facility from different Va.gov hubs.
- As a Veteran, I want to view high level location information included with the search results (ie: Phone number, Today's hours. Directions, Service selected)

*What use cases have been identified as edge?*
- As a Veteran, I need information about parking and campus layout so that I am more prepared to visit the facility. (WIP)

### Rejected Solutions
*What other approaches did we consider and why were they rejected?*

### Proposed Solution & Value Proposition
*A brief description of the proposed solution, including its unique value proposition.*

### Success Criteria
*How do we define success? Failure?*
- VA Health search refinements will decrease x% by (date).
- User satisfaction ratings will increase by x% by (date).

### Risk factors
What could go wrong and what is our plan to mitigate risk?

### Definition of Done

- [ ] The Veteran must be able to successfully search for a VHA, VBA, NCA or Vet Center facility.
- [ ] High level location information is included in search results.
- [ ] The Veteran can view the name, address, phone number, directions, hours of operation and services offered for the chosen facility. 
- [ ] The Veteran can initiate a facility search from various high traffic pages within Va.gov. 
- [ ] Veterans using assistive technology can achieve the stated goals above.  
- [ ] The link to TriWest facility locator is removed. 

## Urgent care

### User Journey
- Eligible Veterans have access to urgent care benefits in their community and need help knowing where and how to receive care. 

### Problem
*What problems are we trying to solve or user pain points we’re seeking to alleviate?*
- The current implementation is not consistent with Veterans' mental models for urgent care. 
- The separate TriWest facility locator leads to a misunderstanding of coverage for the returned providers.
- The current implementation considers only TriWest network providers. Future state will also include Optum network providers. 
- Users don't have a easy way to search for urgent care facilities.

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran in the Tricare network area, I want to...
  - find an urgent care facility so that I can have my immediate health care need met.
  - find a retail pharmacy so that I can have fill my prescription. 
  - understand my available benefit so I can be prepared for my visit to the urgent care/retail pharmacy.
- As a Veteran in the Optum network area, I want to...
  - find an urgent care facility so that I can have my immediate health care need met.
  - find a retail pharmacy so that I can have fill my prescription. 
  - understand my available benefit so I can be prepared for my visit to the urgent care/retail pharmacy.
  
*What use cases have been identified as edge?*
- As a Veteran in neither a Tricare or Optum metwork area, I want to...
  - find an urgent care facility so that I can have my immediate health care need met.
  - find a retail pharmacy so that I can have fill my prescription. 
  - understand my available benefit so I can be prepared for my visit to the urgent care/retail pharmacy.

### Rejected Solutions
*What other approaches did we consider and why were they rejected?*

### Proposed Solution & Value Proposition
*A brief description of the proposed solution, including its unique value proposition.*

### Success Criteria
*How do we define success? Failure?*
- Community Care search refinements will decrease x% by (date).
- Urgent care searches using  the modernized Facility Locator will increase  x% by (date).
- The percentage of users searching for urgent care who download the benefit PDF will be x% by (date).

### Risk factors
- [ ] This UX redesign is reliant on the data provided via PPMS and is dependent on the resolution of existing data concerns.
- [ ] This work is dependent on the availability of Optum network information. 

### Definition of Done

- [ ] The Veteran must be able to successfully search for an urgent care facility.
- [ ] The Veteran must be able to successfully search for a retail pharmacy.
- [ ] High level location information is included in search results.
- [ ] The Veteran can view the name, address, phone number, directions, hours of operation and services offered for the chosen facility.

# _Facility Locator UX Redesign_

## User Journey
**

## Problem
*What problems are we trying to solve or user pain points weâ€™re seeking to alleviate?*
- The current implementation is not consistent with Veterans' mental models for urgent care. 
- The separate TriWest facility locator leads to a misunderstanding of coverage for the returned providers.
- The current implementation considers only TriWest network providers. Future state will also include Optum network providers. 

## User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users? What use cases have been identified as edge and why?*
- As a Veteran, I want to find an urgent care facility so that I can have my immediate health care need met.
- As a Veteran, I want to find a retail pharmacy so that I can have fill my prescription. 
- As a Veteran, I want to understand my available benefit so I can be prepared for my visit to the urgent care/retail pharmacy.

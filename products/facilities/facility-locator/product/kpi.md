# VSA - Facility Locator: KPI Setting (WIP)

## Product Line
- Unauthenticated Experience
## North Star: TBD
## Product
- Facility Locator 
## High Level Objectives
- Work with Veterans to design and deliver the best digital experience in the federal government.
- Provide a single, consolidated place across VA where a veteran can easily find and understand high-level information about facilities 
- Design customer-focused, data-driven interactions to improve ease of use and comprehension 
## Pain Points
- Finding a facility is frustrating for Veterans. The process is lengthy and not always successful.
- Searching for a facility often requires use of more than one Facility Locator, resulting in inconsistent presentation of information and confusing navigation. 
- Search results can be incomplete and/or incorrect. 
- Information presented can be easily misunderstood.
## Desired Outcomes (WIP)
- Reduced time spent on finding facility information.
  - _I notice VSP has this:"90% of user requests are served in <100 ms (latency)" or do we want to measure in "clicks"_
- Enhanced Veteran comprehension about available services, where to access the services and how they will be covered 
  - (_how can we measure this?_)
- Reduced number of calls regarding facilities and scheduling and satisfaction
  - (_how can we measure this?_)
## Hypotheses
- By ____, we expect search performance to be on par with private sector industry standard. 
- By redesigning the UI around Community Care and Urgent Care services, we expect Veterans to find and understand information for these services more quickly. 
- By implementing Health Services taxonomy, we expect Veterans to be able to search and identify the services they seek.

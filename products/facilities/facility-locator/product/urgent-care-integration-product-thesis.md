# Urgent Care Integration Product Thesis 
## Why are we working on this next?
- Veterans are unable to easily find an urgent care facility using Va. gov.
- The current workflow causes confuson about the related benefit coverage. 
## What are the use cases for this?
- As a Veteran, I can find the care and information I need using my own natural language. 
## What problems do we need to solve?
- The current implementation is confusing to Veterans and they are unable to find a location more often than not.  
- The separate TriWest facility locator leads to a misunderstanding of coverage for the returned providers.
- The current implementation is not consistent with Veterans' mental models for urgent care.

# Facility Locator 2.0

All about the 2019-2020 roadmap to make the next version of the product even better for users.

## Product goals
- Integrate urgent care facility and urgency care pharmacy facilities into the product
  - Here is VA's current product: <https://vaurgentcarelocator.triwest.com/>
- Update the product's information architecture to organize facilities based on users' mental models (e.g., mental health care vs. Vet Center)
- Update the product's UI and interaction design so users can get to facility results in just a few clicks/taps
- Update facility detail page to match new VAMC facility page design
  - Here is a health facility detail page design: <https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/>
- Surface basic Veteran-benefit eligibility information for each facility type (e.g., health care facility, community care provider, etc.)
- Use the VHA health service taxonomy for health facilities
- Fix bugs

## Design problems
- Users don't have a way to get to urgency care facilities

## What to research
- Pain points and bright spots with the current product (i.e., evaluative usability testing)
- How users 
- How/if we should integrate content editing of facility details pages using the Drupal CMS (more here: 

## Engineering goals

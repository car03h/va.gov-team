# Meeting to discuss AMA v. Legacy appeals content on the va.gov website

### Current State

#### As of right now there is both legacy appeals and AMA content living side-by-side in the va.gov website.

- Because users can leverage both the legacy appeals process _and_ the AMA appeals process, information on both processes can be found on the website.
- The AMA content is somewhat in its own 'vertical' because the intent was to keep them more separated as the users could still choose one process v. the other.
- One of the more [vital pages to the appeals information flow] (https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/) currently displays mostly legacy appeals information. However, content team has been working with AMA SMEs to update that page to incorporate more AMA process into it.
- It's a priority to keep the legacy content because users can still file legacy appeals.
- No indication on when we might make the 'full on' switch for AMA process to dominate that landing page.
- Action Item: Determine what happens to legacy appeals filing after Feb 2020 (i.e. can users still file a legacy form past this point?)

### Things to Consider

- As the AMA Feb 2020 date draws nearer, we should consider how we might leverage existing flows to better navigate to the Decision Reviews section of the website.
- We can expect some assimilation of content for AMA and legacy on the [file an appeal] (https://www.va.gov/disability/file-an-appeal/) page moving forward.

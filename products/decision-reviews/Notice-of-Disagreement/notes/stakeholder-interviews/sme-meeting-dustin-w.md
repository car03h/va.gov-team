## Notice of Disagreement - SME meeting with Dustin W.


*Can you tell us a little bit about yourself / your roles and experience within the appeals process?*

- Board attorney for 6 years - product manager on Caseflow - data analyst



*Can you give us more of a higher level process overview when someone submits a Notice of Disagreement form? What happens after submission, process-wise?*

- It's unlike other lines of business (supplemental or higher level) for AMA/NOD

- Veteran will appeal a rating decision - decision by NCA or VHA - or a SC or HLR by those agencies

- The veteran would send form into P.O. Box or fax line

- Scanned into centralized mail portal - intake staff at the board - manages centralized mail repo

- They do machine read which box is checked in 10182 (question 11a,b,c)

- They then triage their intake

- Promised as best as possible - 365 days

- From centralized portal - goes to VBMS - Goes into Caseflow intake - finds the veteran

- Asks when form was filed, lane selected, etc

- If there is an ineligible issue - review the NOD and make sure they are looking for the right info from the right decision

- Asks if appellant is non-veteran - more likely a representative

- Compensation and pension - 95% of what comes through

- Take a look at what issues are on appeal - NOD must be filed within a year

- Then will be added as an item in Caseflow cue

- VSO - would have to complete informal hearing presentation
- Video hearing - can request to have hearing in person

- There needs to be an association - from VBA and other processes

- Distinction is the veterans law judge - Mostly they come to the board because of veteran law judge

- As far as how most of the process is handled, that's mostly it. 

### Other things to consider

- Board might have concerns - selection wizard might be viewed as legal advice
- Important to note that weâ€™re not giving advice as this is more of a guide

## Notice of Disagreement - SME Meeting with Steve K


**Which form is associated to the new NOD appeals process? (we currently have found forms 9, 10182 and VBA-21-0958)**

**Form 9** - old process (legacy process) - will continue to run for another 4 months til Feb 19, 2020

**Form VBA-21-0958** - Old process (legacy process)

**Form 10182** - New process - AMA - Notice of Disagreement

	
- A month before the cutoff date for legacy (Feb 19, 2020), they will be deciding on whether or not they want to extend that further



**What is the internal or business process for handling and processing a Notice of Disagreement form?**

- Notice of disagreement distinction - it is distinctly different because it goes to another line of business than the 0995 and 0996 forms (SC form and HLR forms) - original line occurs for 0995-0996

- NOD always goes to board of veterans appeals - independent organization - no more dealing with lines of business

- Board appeal is NOD - intake administrators and some cases attorneys who look at it initially - could be a mail intermediary? Scan info in

- GS4’s / GS12’s sometimes put it into caseflow

	*Hours spent for that work?* 

	- 25 people involved in any intake - could enter in about 10 minutes - takes about $1.00
	
	- $10-$15 for non happy and $50-60 for incorrect path

- Case by case after initial contact - must select 1 of 3 dockets you’d like it to advance on (direct, supplemental evidence, hearing)


- Gets put into monolithic software 

- Then there is a decision by a judge

Note: could ask PM Premal (PM), Lauren P - what happens after intake? 


**Who might we be able to talk to, to determine how many NOD paper forms have been submitted since the inception of the AMA law?**

- Caseflow is the source of record for that DB - dump that into Lookr - tableau - Appeals API channel - monthly 

- Appeals intake - October - 4800, 125k appeals every year - AMA would split evenly 75k board appeals, SC most popular


- What technical or backend details should we be aware of? Where is the data coming from and who might handle data being sent via the digitized form?

- Caseflow is the source for all appeals - records all in caseflow

	- Lighthouse API

	- Corporate DB


*What are the differences between NOD and CS?HLR?*

- new evidence yes, but also docket lanes (one of which are hearings)

- Hardest thing will be including the lines of business for supplemental claims

- Compensation and pension claims - we can get that from VBMS 95%

- Education line of business with new evidence, loan appeals, guarantee appeals



**Who might I be able to talk to, to determine how many legacy appeals have been submitted since the inception of the AMA law vs. new forms that utilize the new process (supplemental claim forms, HLR forms, NOD forms)?**

- Sometimes they just have to reject legacy appeals and say ‘file the correct form’



**How does the VA communicate (or how has it communicated in the past) the new AMA law / new lane process to veterans (by mail, media, online only, etc)?**


- Most appeals that get submitted get help - VSOs, reps, friendly vet orgs, informal backchannels

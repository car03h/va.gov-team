## Resident clinics
- how many veterans are seen by attending vs. resident physicians?
  - Sizable minority, if not majority
- How does the attending physician interact with residents and appointments?
  - PCMM tracks relationship, attendings are paths of escalation
  - VA largest trainer of residents, they move around a lot (e.g., 6 week rotation at a private clinic), so also need to track who gets their messages when they're not there
- How do Veterans decide which residents they want to see?
  - Continuity is important, only really gets trumped by appointment wait time (at the veteran's discretion)
- How many residents are in a PACT?
  - PACT team defined in PCMM; 
- How often to residents come & go within a PACT?
  - A lot, because of rotations and the nature of being a resident
  - All over the place, sometimes there for 6 weeks and gone for 6 weeks, sometimes there for years
- What kind of lift is it for site admins to appopriately set residents up in VATS?
- Should attendings be schedulable?
  - Most should be
- Could we schedule people with the last clinic they were seen in?
  - If new patient clinic, wouldn't want to schedule them back into that after initial consult


## Clinics
- How do we get availability information about a clinic? How expensive are the queries? How long do they take?
- How could we go about aggregating the options for a given stop code?
- What are the factors that go into determining which clinic to book a veteran into?
- Whatâ€™s the importance of secondary stop codes? Do they provide veterans with meaningful differentiation in services?
- Are we able to show, by type of care or stop code, the last clinic that a Veteran successfully had an appointment in withing that health system?
- What is the timeline for patient-friendly names of clinics? Is it at all feasible to guide or nudge that process?
- If PCMM doesn't know which clinic active, how can we tell in the front end?

## Appointment duration
- How do we know how long an appointment should be?
- How do we know whether someone needs a long or short appointment?
- Can we ask veterans a question about being new, or can we deduce this from existing data?

## Direct Scheduling
- How many appointments need to be rescheduled or can't be fulfilled because of some scheduling error (e.g., self-scheduling into wrong clinic)
- What is the time implication to schedulers of correcting these errors? 
- What are the common self-scheduling appointment errors?
- Can we increase the number of types of care that are self-schedulable? How?
- What is the direct scheduling process after a veteran hits 'confirm / sdchedule' in VAOS? Do clerks ever filter these requests?
- What is the single biggest thing we can do (within our scope) to improve the veteran scheduling experience? What potential outcomes excite you the most?
- Do clinics/facilities have any control over how or when appointments can be cancelled online?

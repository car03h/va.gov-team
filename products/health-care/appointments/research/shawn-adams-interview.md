## Clinics
- How do we get availability information about a clinic? How expensive are the queries? How long do they take?
- How could we go about aggregating the options for a given stop code?
- What are the factors that go into determining which clinic to book a veteran into?
- Whatâ€™s the importance of secondary stop codes? Do they provide veterans with meaningful differentiation in services?
- Are we able to show, by type of care or stop code, the last clinic that a Veteran successfully had an appointment in withing that health system?
- What is the timeline for patient-friendly names of clinics? Is it at all feasible to guide or nudge that process? 

## Appointment duration
- How do we know how long an appointment should be?
- How do we know whether someone needs a long or short appointment?
- Can we ask veterans a question about being new, or can we deduce this from existing data?

## Direct Scheduling
- How many appointments need to be rescheduled or can't be fulfilled because of some scheduling error (e.g., self-scheduling into wrong clinic)
- What is the time implication to schedulers of correcting these errors? 
- What are the common self-scheduling appointment errors?
- Can we increase the number of types of care that are self-schedulable? How?
- What is the direct scheduling process after a veteran hits 'confirm / sdchedule' in VAOS? Do clerks ever filter these requests?
- What is the single biggest thing we can do (within our scope) to improve the veteran scheduling experience? What potential outcomes excite you the most?

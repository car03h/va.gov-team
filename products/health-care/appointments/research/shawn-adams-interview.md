## Resident clinics
- how many veterans are seen by attending vs. resident physicians?
- Should attending physicians be schedulable at all?
- Should veterans be able to pick which resident they self-schedule with?
- How many residents are in a PACT

## Clinics
- Is it possible to abstract these away so that veterans don’t need to worry about booking into a clinic? E.g., aggregate available times across all clinics at a facility with a given stop code.
- What are the factors that go into determining which clinic to book a veteran into?
- What’s the importance of secondary stop codes? Do they provide veterans with meaningful differentiation in services?

## Appointment duration
- How do we know how long an appointment should be?
- How do we know whether someone needs a long or short appointment?
- Can we ask veterans a question about being new, or can we deduce this from existing data?


## Types of care

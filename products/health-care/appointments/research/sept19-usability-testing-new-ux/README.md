This folder contains the research materials for the user research studies on VAOS usability from September 2019. The team was asked to deliver direct schedule, VA request, and community care request flows by November 2019. 


# Study 1 (Sept 9-13) 
Study 1 covered the new community care and VA request flow to account for ux changes as a result of the new drive time API calls.

Research questions included:
- How well does our strategy of "only showing Veterans options that they have" within VAOS work w/r/t user flow? 
- Do users know what they can do in VAOS? 
- What is the user's "goal" or "mental process" for scheduling an appointment? 
  - i.e. Do they think about Type of care first? Provider? Location? Health concern?
- Do the new approaches to the flows inspire more/less confidence for Veterans regarding booking appointments online for VA or CC appointments? 
- Do the new user interface and user experience components introduce any pain points or confusion? 
  - i.e. How well does our handling of "confirm address" / "choose VA location" flow? 
  - i.e. Does the time selection tool make sense? 
  - i.e. Are Veterans confused by the community care options? 
- Do Veterans understand the difference between pending and scheduled appointments? 
  - Is "pending" a word that resonates? 
- What  content / additional content is needed to facilitate decision support at key moments in the appointment scheduling process? 

## Study 2 (Sept 25-30) 
Study 2 will cover the direct scheduling flows, plus any changes to the request flows. 

Research questions included:
-Are Veterans receptive to a choice-architecture approach of limiting self-schedule only to a clinic where a user last booked (within a set time frame for a type of care)?
- How do Veterans make a choice about self-scheduling when faced with a complex list of clinics?
- Is the date and time selection tool intuitive?
- How much detail (which data fields) are useful to a Veteran w/r/t their appointments?
= Do Veterans want to see cancelled appointments in a VAOS list? Do they want those lists inline with other confirmed/pending appointments, or in a separate cancellation list?
- What content is needed to facilitate decision support at key moments in the appointment scheduling process?

## Future studies needed
Future studies will need to cover the provider flow, express care, messaging, and accessibility + usability issues with the direct schedule flow.

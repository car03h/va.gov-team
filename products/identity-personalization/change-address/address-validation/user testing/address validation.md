# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience/Personalization: Address Override

## Goals
1.  **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Address Override.  Authenticated Experience/Personalization.

2.  **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

Vet360 is providing Address Validation.  There are several situations where the Veteran will need make choices in order to properly select a more accurate address option or to override provided options and use their entered address. 
This is sometimes due to the situations where Pitney Bowes Spectrum address database has not yet caught up to the cartographical realities of the US housing market,  and the Veteran should be able to confirm that "yes, this is actually a real address."

This Address Override Feature needs UX in various places to allow the Veteran to complete their address edit workflow easily and accurately.
  1. Veteran enters accurate address.  If the entered address matches the database address with the highest Confidence Score, the updated address displays on the UI.
  2.  Veteran enters inaccurate address.  The UI will display the entered address and up to 3 address suggestions and allow the Veteran to edit the entered address or the Veteran is required to select 1 address to continue to complete the update.
  3.  Veteran eneters inaccurate address that the database cannot identify.  The UI will display the entered address with no address suggestions and allow the user to edit the address or continue with the address override.
  
  We have clickable prototypes that map out each of the mentioned UX scenarios and needs user testing to answer several questions regarding the workflwo and UI.

3.  **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

- Is the messaging clear about their entered address - 'Unrecognized' - to the Veteran?
- Is it
- Does it cause the Veteran any confusion if the 'Continue/Update/Cancel' buttons on the mobile form

4.  **Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**



## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
  - **Sample Methodologies**: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing. 
  - **Also mention:** in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 
- Moderator:
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers:

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**

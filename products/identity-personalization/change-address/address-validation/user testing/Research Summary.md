## Background

We are incorporating address validation into the VA.gov profile so we can detects if someone has entered an address that the USPS may not be able to deliver mail to. Currently we only perform frontend validation to make sure someone has entered all the required fields for an address, and that those fields are filled out in the correct format (eg. at least five digits for a zip code). However, we are not currently detecting whether addresses are recognized by USPS or not. VA Profile (formerly Vet360) supports this functionality on the backend and needs VA.gov to support it on the frontend so users updating their addresses aren't at risk of saving an address that the VA ultimately can't deliver to.

This round of user testing aimed to test the designs that walk users through what to do if we detect that their address may not be recognized by USPS.

## Methods

### What We Did

We conducted usability testing with an [InVision prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/34UP5BMUAJF#/391945409_1-_Intro_Screen) over GoToMeeting.

### Dates

We conducted interviews between November 13 â€“ November 21, 2019.

### Participants

We talked to **4 veterans**:

- All participants received at least one benefit from the VA.
- 2 women; 2 men.
- 3 participants 55+; 1 participant under 35
- 4 Army; 1 Marine

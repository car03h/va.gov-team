## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about updating your address at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 – 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

## Warm-up Questions (7 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

*Start recording.*

OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.

2. Do you receive benefits from the VA? 
- (If yes) May I ask which benefits?
3. Since receiving benefits from the VA, have you ever had to update your mailing address? 
- (If yes) Can you tell me about this experience?
4. Since receiving benefits from the VA, was there ever a time when you were not receiving mail you expected to receive from the VA? Did you ever find out why you weren't receiving this mail?
- If yes, figure out if this was because they had the wrong address on file.
- If applicable, ask how they figured out they needed to update their address with the VA. 
5. On a scale from 0 – 5, where 0 is not at all important and 5 is extremely important, how important do you think it is to keep your home and mailing address up to date with the VA?
- Did you know that the VA having the correct address on file for you could affect whether you receive VA correspondence, and it could potentially affect your benefits?
- Depending on the answer here, ask them about how we could better help them to keep their address up to date.
6. Have you ever signed in to VA.gov before? (If yes) About how often do you use the website?

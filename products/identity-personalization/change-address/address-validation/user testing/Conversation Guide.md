# Conversation Guide: Dashboard 2.0 Veteran Interviews

### Project-specific setup

For this round of testing, we will be asking users to sign in and to show us how they use their dashboard, so most of the testing should take place on their screen. However, we should also have staging open on the moderator's end in case there are things we want to walk through with the participant that are not in their account.

On moderator's computer

- Go to staging(https://staging.va.gov).
- Sign in with user 226.

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you manage benefits online. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 – 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** For this session, I will have you share your screen and ask you to show us how you manage benefits online, so this means that the information in your account would be part of the recording. Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

## Transfer presenter controls to participant (2 minutes)

OK, before we start the session or start our recording, we need to pass presenter controls to you. I'm going go ahead and do that now. If you are not already using the desktop application for GTM, you will be asked to download it.

*Pass presenter rights*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.

*Start recording.*

2. Do you have a VA.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?
3. Do you use the My VA personalized dashboard on VA.gov? If so, how often?
4. What benefits do you currently receive from the VA?
5. Do you use VA.gov to manage this/these benefit(s)?
6. (If more than one benefit) Which benefit do you find yourself most often managing online/on VA.gov?

## Managing benefits (10 – 15 minutes)

1. Can you show me how you manage your [one of their benefits] benefits online?

As part of this section, assess the following:

- Their flow, and what kind of tasks they are trying to accomplish.
- What their pain points are.
- How often they use VA.gov or another site to manage this benefit.
- Whether they use the dashboard as part of this.
- Whether any data is missing that they need, especially on VA.gov.
- What we could improve overall to make this experience easier/better.

(If time, and if it feels productive, ask about another benefit they've mentioned)

## The dashboard (10 – 15 minutes)

Alright, let's take a look at your My VA personalized dashboard.

(Ask only if not covered in the previous section)

1. What do you use this page for?
2. How often?

OK, now let's talk about the rest of the dashboard.

1. What do you think "Find VA Benefits" is?
- Is this kind of information helpful to you or not? Why is that?
- What kind of information would you want to see to help you get started with VA benefits you were learning about for the first time?
2. What do you think "Your Applications" is?
- Is this kind of information helpful to you or not? Why is that?
- How could we improve how you track applications on VA.gov?
3. (If applicable) What do you think Track Claims is?
- Is this kind of information helpful to you or not? Why is that?
- What kind of information would be helpful to see on your dashboard about your claims?
4. (If applicable) What do you think Manage your VA health care is?
- Is this kind of information helpful to you or not? Why is that?
- What kind of information would be helpful to see on your dashboard about your health care status?

OK, now let's talk about the dashboard in general.

1. What are your overall impressions of the dashboard?
2. Do you find it easy or hard to use? Why?
3. What information is not on here that would help your to more easily manage your benefits and your experience at the VA? How would that information help you?
4. Is there anything that you would remove or take away from the dashboard as it is now?
5. In addition to anything we may have already discussed, what would you change about the dashboard to make it something that would help you more easily manage your benefits and your experience at the VA?
6. How do you feel about how the dashboard is organized (ie. Find VA benefits, Your Apps, etc)? Would you change it, or keep it the same?
- (If they don't mention this) Do you feel the dashboard would be improved or not by organizing it by benefit type? Or would that make no difference to you?
7. Anything else that could be improved?

## The dashboard and homepage (5 minutes)

Now let's talk about the VA.gov homepage.

1. When you are logged in, do you use the VA.gov homepage? If so, how?
2. Which would you say you use more *when you are logged in* — the My VA dashboard or the homepage?
3. If the My VA page either replaced or merged with the existing VA.gov homepage **only** when you are logged in, how, if at all, do you feel this would change your experience of using VA.gov?

## Post-Task Interview (2 minutes)

1. Overall, how did you feel about all of the screens we looked at today?
2. In addition to anything you have already mentioned, how could this overall experience be improved?

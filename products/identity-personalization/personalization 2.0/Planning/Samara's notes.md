# Planning — 10/9/2019

## Project progression

To help scope each phase of personalization 2.0, I thought it would be helpful to document a high level path between personalization 1.0 all the way through to what I think personalization 3.0 might be. I think having that final vision in sight will help us figure out some of more specific updates we'll be making as we revisit My VA, Profile, and Account.

### Personalization 1.0

#### MVP: Spring 2018

Creation of the initial logged in experience:

- Dashboard: Manage applications, and see updates to claims, prescriptions, and messages.
- Profile: See your personal, contact, and military information.
- Account: Landing page for sign in settings and security.

#### Additional features

- Find VA Benefits: Added winter 2018. Outlines the steps to get started with each benefit and let's people select the benefits they're most interested in.
- Health care status: Added spring 2019. Includes health care application statuses and enrollment information.

### Personalization 2.0

Goals of personalization 2.0:

Clean up the personalized pages so they are easier to use, find, and navigate (as outlined in the personalization 2.0 discovery 

### Personalization 3.0

As of 10/2019, I see Personalization 3.0 as a separate, logged in portal for VA.gov. This is similar to a health care portal or logging into your bank account. While you can get back to the main "content" site, you're effectively in a separate site portal where the navigation is focused on managing the user's experience instead of marketing to them.

In my very preliminary thinking, this site include:

- Sections:
  - A homepage/dashboard
  - Notifications
  - Your health care (think basically rolling MHV tools into this site)
  - Your benefits (disability, education, etc... basically any valuable enrollment information and history)
  - Your records
  - Your profile and settings
- Link bank to the "main" VA.gov in the main navigation.
- Link out to content pages on the "main" site as neccesary.
- URL would still be something like VA.gov/my-VA, not a subdomain. 

# Initial planning — 9/2019

## Potential project breakdown

1. Combine Profile and Account
2. Updated My VA/Homepage approach
- MVP of internal notifications
- Homepage or dashboard 2.0 update (note: this may be in tandem with number 2 depending on how we decide to execute this project)

## Combine Profile/Account planning

This likely won't involve much pushback or conversations with other teammates, so we can probably dive into this first. 

### Planning
- Review plan with DSVA team (9/26/19)

### IA & card sort
- Create content inventory of what needs to be included in the combined Profile and Account section.
- Propose new IA.
- Review card sort results for nomenclature.
- Share proposal with Mikki and make updates.
- Create closed card sort.
- Circulate, evaluate card sort and make updates.
- Review wayfinding in logged out states and on content pages — what content pages do we need? What additional wayfinding elements do we need to add?
- Update main navigation.

### Design
- Make design updates.
- Create mockups for all states.
- Update as needed based on technical requirements and research.

### User testing 
- Plan and recruit for user testing.
- Make updates based user testing results.

### Development

- Technical discovery
- Initial build
- Updates based on user testing

### Pre-launch

- QA
- UAT
- Launch activities
- Launch

## Updated My VA/Homepage approach

- Work with Lauren, Steve, Andy, and other team members to figure out exactly what content we need to account for on a homepage/dashboard.
- Determine general approach 
  — Are we keeping My VA? Are we scrapping it? 
  - What updates, if any, need to happen to the logged in homepage? 
  - Do any stakeholders need to be involved in logged in homepage updates? 

### Notifications

#### Discussions

- Talk to Clarice about how this overlaps with her work.

#### Research

- **Do we need more research? What are our questions?**
  - What makes someone sign in to check a claim, prescription, message, etc?
  - Will people find in-app notifications useful, or do they just want email/text?
  - What other in-app notifications might be helpful?
  - What info do people want to see?
    - Thoughts from Kevin: I wonder how we might develop personas to guide our platform level thinking. E.g. "the only-health info," the "tell me everything," the "I want just the basics" vs. "I'll read the detail."

#### Design

- Take inventory of what functionality we have that we could convert into notifications.
- Determine IA and interaction design approach.
- Determine navigation changes.
- Work with copy.
- Work with visual design as needed.

#### User testing 

- Plan and recruit for user testing.
- Make updates based user testing results.

#### Development

- Technical discovery
- Initial build
- Updates based on user testing

#### Pre-launch

- QA
- UAT
- Launch activities

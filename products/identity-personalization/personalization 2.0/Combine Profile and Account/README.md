## The Problem

### Background

#### The main problem

- **Confusion about the difference between Profile/Account** — We have observed that the difference between Profile and Account is either not as important or not as clear to VA.gov users as we thought it was. 
  - During [user testing for the direct deposit feature](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Profile/Direct%20Deposit/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Research/Usability%20testing/Research%20Summary.md#we-need-to-make-it-easier-to-find-the-direct-deposit-tool), participants were split as to whether this functionality belonged in the Profile or made more sense on the Account page. 
  - Through a [card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Card%20sort/Research%20Summary.md#takeaways), we observed that participants overwhelmingly put features we currently have separated between the Profile and Account pages into one "Personal Information" section.
- **Scaling** — Having separate Profile/Account pages has made it difficult to figure out where new features should live since there are often arguments for them to live in both sections.
- **Wayfinding** — We could do a better job of guiding users to the Profile/Account from outside those pages. 
- **Visual design** — We have not effectively employed [the design system](https://design.va.gov/). The Profile and Account pages are designed like content pages, so adding new content has made these pages extremely lenghty and hard to scan.

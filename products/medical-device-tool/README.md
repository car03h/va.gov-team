## The Problem
With the future retirement of eBenefits, all of the tools contained within must be integrated into the VA.gov website, including the tool Veterans currently use to order medical devices like prosthetic socks and hearing aid batteries. Today, there are 7 disperate ways Veterans may order hearing aid batteries or prosthetic socks from the VA, and this information is neither consistent nor simple to find.

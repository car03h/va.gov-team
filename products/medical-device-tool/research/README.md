## Preliminary Product Research
_Timeline: Oct 23 - Nov 20_

This research was conducted to help clarify the current state of the problem space and form a common understanding in the BAM2 and DSVA Teams. This research was deemed necessary to understand this problem space in the absence of readily-available stakeholders at kickoff. During this time, we investigated publicly-available knowledge about the ordering process as it exists today and the disabilities for which the medical devices were meant.

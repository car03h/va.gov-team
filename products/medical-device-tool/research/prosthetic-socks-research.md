## Prosthetic Socks

### What are prosthetic socks?

Prosthetic “stump” socks are tubular medical or clothing accessories with a blind end that are fashioned similar to socks, usually without a heel. Socks are often worn between the socket of the prosthetic and a sheath/liner. Comfort while wearing prosthetics is achieved by good pressure distribution and the managing friction.

Amputation stumps can be sensitive to cold or heat, allergic, chemical or mechanical irritation, so the selection of appropriate liners and socks is important.

#### What prosthetic socks are for:

- Managing size fluctuations in amputation stumps.
- Managing sensitivity to heat and cold in amputation stumps.
- Creating a more comfortable fit for prosthetic appliances.
- Reducing friction between stumps and prosthetic appliances.
- Managing perspiration by wicking away moisture from the skin.
- Reducing discomfort associated with phantom pain.

#### Sock materials & design: 
- Socks with metal fabric can be worn to reduce phantom sensation or pain
- Compression socks can be worn to reduce tissue congestion or swelling
- Socks made of wool are worn to keep the stump warm
- Socks or liners can contain skin care products on their inside that are released into the skin

### Anatomy of prosthetic socks:

- Standard Above Knee, Below Knee, and Arm socks are measured by width at the toe, width at the top, and length from toe to top, for example: 2” x 5” x 12”

- Sock thickness is measured in “ply” rating, most commonly from 1-ply to 6-ply.

### Wearing prosthetic socks:

Prosthetic socks are often adjusted several times a day, according to the level of fluid present in the residual limb. Prosthetics wearers must adjust by switching sock thickness via switching ply, adding socks, or subtracting socks. Fluid changes are caused by excess heat in summer weather, forgetting to wear a stump shrinker at night, letting the limb hang down without a prosthetic, and extreme changes in daily activity.


### Caring for prosthetic socks:

Prosthetic socks need to be washed daily, especially when worn without a liner/sheath. Many modern socks are machine washable, but some may need to be washed by hand.

## Hip Disarticulation Socks

### What is hip disarticulation?

> Hip disarticulation and hemipelvectomy, also known as transpelvic amputation, are types of amputation that leave the amputee with the loss of three joints: the hip, the knee, and the ankle. Hip disarticulation and hemipelvectomy are considered to be some of the most difficult amputations to overcome, both physically and emotionally, as they can have an adverse impact on an amputee’s self-image, bowels, bladder, and sexual functions.

### Hip disarticulation socks:

Hip disarticulation socks are similar to ‘stump’ socks in their functionality, but look more like a traditional boxer brief with one (or both) leg openings closed with a blind end.

## Symes Socks

### Syme Amputations

A traditional Syme’s amputation is a disarticulation of the ankle where the heel pad is preserved. Individuals with this amputation are able to put weight upon the distal end of the stump.

### Symes Socks

Symes socks are similar in construction and functionality to the standard ‘stump’ socks, but typically have a wider toe to accommodate the residual foot.

## Shrinkers

A shrinker is “an elastic wrap or compression sock worn on the residual limb to reduce swelling and to help properly shape the residual limb.” When not wearing their prosthetics, people with amputations should wear a shrinker to prevent edema. Shrinkers reduce limb volume fluctuations. Shrinkers are often hand wash only, and prosthetics users will need to have a minimum of two in order to have one available at all times. 

## Sheaths

The function of a sheath is to form a protective barrier between the skin of the residual limb and the prosthetic. They are often made of nylon and resemble smooth hosiery and are generally worn in conjunction to socks in order to gain a better fit and more cushion. Sheaths and liners also wick moisture from the skin and keep prosthetic socks from soiling as quickly.


## Liners

A prosthetic liner is a protective layer that can be worn over the sheath to increase comfort and friction. They are often made of flexible materials like silicone. Liners, along with sheaths, can be worn beneath socks.


## Prosthetics Use in Veterans

Sources: [1](https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-11-02138-116.pdf), [2](https://advancedamputees.com/amputee-statistics-you-ought-know)

- Less than .5% of veterans have experienced traumatic amputation.
  - As of Sept. 1, 2010, there have been 1,621 new U.S. amputee “Wounded Warriors” as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn.
- 99.1% of veterans with traumatic amputation are transitioned to VA care within 5 years of separation and as of 2011, 93.2% of amputees had used VA Prosthetic Care.
- After separation from active duty, over 80 percent of amputees had comorbidity diagnoses in each of the following categories: 
  - mental disorders
  - diseases of the nervous system and sense organs
  - diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
- Lifetime healthcare costs for people with limb loss is $509,275 compared to $361,200 for people without limb loss.


## Ordering Socks

- Orders should be placed through ROES, either by a VHA provider, mail, phone, email, or eBenefits form submission.
- Items can be shipped to the requesting service or specific veteran
- Individual veteran records should be established through ROES by the appropriate VA service
- Once established in DALC records as having continuing eligibility status, veterans then may order socks directly (using VA form 2345)
- Returns: 
  - For Telehealth devices, send back monitors only. Do not send back the peripherals
- Shipping:
  - All Orders are processed in the order in which they are received except for emergency orders
  - After orders are processed and serial numbers of devices requiring registration is complete, items are assembled for packaging
  - Orders with multiple items are assembled and packed as one shipment
  - UPS picks up packages for shipment to end users. (Veterans or Stations)
  - All orders are sent 2-Day Air regardless of routine or priority order status

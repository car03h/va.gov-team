### Platforms

#### By Mail
* **For hearing aid batteries or accessories:** Fill out a Veteran’s Request for Batteries and Accessories (VA Form 2346) card. If you’re ordering hearing aid wax guards, please write down the type of guard if you have that information from your audiologist. You should have received a VA Form 2346 in your last battery order. If you don’t have the form, call your local VA audiology clinic or follow the instructions below to order batteries by phone.
* **For prosthetic socks:** Fill out a Veteran’s Request for Prosthetic Socks (VA Form 2345)

Completed forms are mailed to: VA Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center, PO Box 25166, Denver, CO 80225-0166

#### By Email
* Email request to dalc.css@va.gov 

#### By Phone
Call the Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (DALC) at 303-273-6200
* **For hearing aid batteries:** select 1 for the Automated Battery Reorder System. Enter your Social Security number and zip code when prompted. Then select which authorized batteries you need to reorder.
* **For prosthetic socks or other accessories (like hearing aid wax guards):** select 2 to speak with a customer service representative.
* **To ask about hearing aid repairs:** select 3.
* **To speak with an operator:** select 0.

#### Via eBenefits
* On the eBenefits platform, Veterans with Premium accounts appear to be able to _reorder_ medical devices through an embedded iframe by selecting from a list of previously-ordered items.

#### Via Remote Order Entry System (ROES)
* The primary user base of ROES appears to be VA Healthcare providers like audiologists and prosthetics specialists, who fill out the singular Online Commodity Order Form. Veterans can access ROES directly as well. 

#### Via MyHealtheVet
* Premium users of MyHealtheVet are able to request batteries and socks from their VA healthcare providers via secure messaging. [Source](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/ss20190521-hearing-loss)

#### Via their VA healthcare providers
* Veterans are always able to work with their VA healthcare providers in order to obtain medical devices and accessories. We hypothesize that VA healthcare providers utilize the ROES system to create orders on behalf of their patients.

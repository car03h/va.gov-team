# Hearing Aid Research

## What batteries can be purchased?

- The [VA Denver Logistics Center (DLC)](https://www.va.gov/opal/about/nacDlc.asp) predominantly provides zinc air batteries
- Different battery types are also available for use in other battery powered devices such as:
  - Artificial larynxes 
  - Assistive listening devices
  - Neuromuscular stimulators
  - Etc.
- A catalogue of available batteries can be found [here](https://www.va.gov/opal/docs/nac/dlc/catalogBatteries.pdf)
- Types of batteries listed in catalogue:
  - Non-rechargeable Battery
    - Alkaline
    - Silver
    - Zinc-Air
  - Rechargeable Battery
    - Nickel Metal Hydride
    - Lithium Ion
  - CI Batteries - Med-El
    - Cochlear Implant Batteries

## Terminology

- HCPCS - Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
  - Set of health care procedure codes based on the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology
- Artificial Larynx
  - Medical device about the size of a small electric razor used to produce clearer speech by those people who have lost their voicebox
    -usually due to cancer of the larynx
  - sometimes referred to as a "throat back"
- Neuromuscular stimulators
  - Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation or NMES uses a device that sends electrical impulses to nerves
    - Causes muscles to contract
  - The electrical stimulation can increase strength and range of motion, and offset the effects of disuse.
  - Contain a power supply (generally rechargeable batteries), a signal generator, a control circuit, a modulating circuit and output circuit, and electrodes ([source](https://www.vha.cc.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001036/content/554400000009145/022012-NMES-NEUROMUSCULAR-ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION-DEVICES))
  - Facilitate voluntary motor control and temporarily reduce spasticity inpatients suffering from spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, or other upper motor neuron disorders ([source](https://www.vha.cc.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001036/content/554400000009145/022012-NMES-NEUROMUSCULAR-ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION-DEVICES))
  
## Cochlear Implant
  
### What are they?
  
Sources: [1](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants)
  
- Surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device to provide a person with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss a modified sense of sound 
- CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve (1)
- Does not restore normal hearing (1)
  - Can give a deaf person a useful representation of sounds in the environment and help him/her/them to understand speech
- Bypasses damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve (1)
- Hearing is different from normal hearing and takes time to learn or relearn (1)
- Allows many people to recognize warning signals, understand other sounds in the environment, and understand speech in person or over the telephone (1)
- Requires both a surgical procedure and significant therapy to learn or relearn the sense of hearing (1)

### What batteries do they use?

- There are subtle differences between each style 
  - Battery size
  - Cell type
- The size is what indicates if a battery will fit in your audio processor, and is named with a letter or number
- The most common battery size for cochlear implants is 675
- The cell type is another name for what fuel the battery uses, and common cell types include zinc-air, silver-oxide, alkaline, and rechargeable
- The type of battery used seems to be a personal choice and is determined by lifestyle 

#### Zinc-Air Batteries

Sources: [1](https://blog.medel.com/batteries-use-cochlear-implant/)

- A lot of power in a small size and are relatively inexpensive to produce
- Good choice for general use when you want a single set of batteries to last a long time
- They need to be in constant contact with oxygen to provide power
- When the zinc in the battery has completely oxidized it will stop producing power and the battery will need to be replaced
- A set of zinc-air batteries will last for approximately 60—90 hours

#### Silver-oxide & Alkaline Batteries

Sources: [1](https://blog.medel.com/batteries-use-cochlear-implant/)

- Both are powered by a chemical reaction inside the battery and therefore don’t need air to function
- *Lifetime of approximately 6—8 hours* per set depending on audio processor and battery pack

#### Rechargeable Batteries

Sources: [1](https://blog.medel.com/batteries-use-cochlear-implant/)

- Don’t need air to work and can be recharged multiple times
- Last approximately 6—8 hours per charge depending on processor and battery pack

## Hearing Loss in Veterans

Sources: [1](https://www.acialliance.org/page/VAPractices), [2](https://www.hearinglife.com/hearing-blog/2018/veterans-and-hearing-loss), [3](https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/62751/veteran-im-hearing-better-now-20-years/)

- 71% of soldiers returning from Iraq or Afghanistan reporting exposure to loud noise (1)
- One in three soldiers returning from a war zone have measurable hearing loss, which can worsen over time (1)
- In 2014, more than 933,000 veterans received disability compensation for hearing loss and nearly 1.3 million received compensation for tinnitus (1)
- A common response by someone who has undergone cochlear implantation is “I got my life back.” (1)

|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| Estimated adults fit with Hearing Aids                       | 378,000 | 1.825M |
| Estimated cochlear implant adult candidates (5% of HA users) | 18,936  | 91,250 |
| Estimated adults implanted with cochlear implants            | 477     | 9,300  |
| Radio (%) cochlear implants / hearing aids                   | 0.1%    | 10.2%  |

- Almost every soldier, sailor, airman or marine will be exposed to very high levels of noise (2)
- For some, a single explosion with sounds exceeding 140 dB can cause irreparable damage instantly (2)
- “I just kinda got used to thinking it would always be half-way. You’re always asking, ‘What’d you say?’ and people kind of shied away from wanting to hold a conversation.”


## Ordering Batteries

Source: [1](https://www.va.gov/opal/docs/nac/dlc/catalogBatteries.pdf)

- Orders should be placed through ROES
- Items can be shipped to the requesting service or specific veteran
- Individual veteran records should be established through ROES by the appropriate VA service
- Once established in DALC records as having continuing eligibility status, veterans then may order batteries directly (using VA form 2346)
- Returns: 
  - For Telehealth devices, send back monitors only. Do not send back the peripherals
- Shipping:
  - All Orders are processed in the order in which they are received except for emergency orders
  - After orders are processed and serial numbers of devices requiring registration is complete, items are assembled for packaging
  - Orders with multiple items are assembled and packed as one shipment
  - UPS picks up packages for shipment to end users. (Veterans or Stations)
  - All orders are sent 2-Day Air regardless of routine or priority order status
  - Only Emergency orders are shipped Next Day Air

# Discovery Project Brief & Planning

This doc should be filled out during different stages of the discovery sprint process. See the [Discovery Sprint How-to](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) for details on the whole process.

## PROJECT BRIEF
_To be filled out with a VA.gov lead prior to starting discovery work._

### Project Name
Medical Device Tool

### Problem Statement
Millions of Veterans depend upon the VA for disability-related medical devices and their accessories. Today, Veterans are able to order prosthetic socks and hearing aid batteries, the two most commonly-ordered medical device accessories, through their respective VA forms (Form 2345 & 2346). There are a number of ways to request these medical devices today, through several different mediums and platforms, providing a disparate experience for Veterans. With the expected sunsetting of eBenefits, BAM2 seeks to match and expand the functionality of the platform on the VA.gov website.

#### How Might We...
- ...reduce the effort of re-ordering hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks for Veterans?
- ...increase visibility of orders after they are placed?
- ...ensure that Veterans do not go without the assistive devices and accessories they need?

## DISCOVERY PLANNING
- [x] Set up product folder in GitHub
- [ ] Create launch checklist
- [x] Create Product Outline
- [ ] Define problem, assumed user and business goals, and other assumptions (Product Outline)
- [ ] Determine POCs, stakeholders, and implementation team (Product Outline)
- [ ] Determine Discovery methods needed
- [ ] Determine user research methods needed
- [ ] Determine what APIs and/or systems to investigate
- [ ] Recruit for stakeholder research
- [ ] Recruit for user research
- [ ] Determine ideal Discovery outputs and artifacts

### Project Details

* What do we know?
  - There are 5 major ways a Veteran can order resupply items: via phone, mail, email, eBenefits resupply applet, or VHA provider.
  - All DLC orders go through ROES, either by VHA provider, call-center agent, or veteran input in the eBenefits applet.
  - Customer eligibility is determined by a VHA provider placing an initial product order. 
  - Customers are only able to reorder previously-supplied items through eBenefits.
  - Items ordered through mail, phone, or email are cross-referenced with the Veteran's profile for eligibility.
  - Veterans often need assistance with determining which resupply items are needed.
  - The eBenefits platform is currently underutilized in Q4 2019 (~4%) while mail-in form (~49%), live phone agents (~19%), and automated phone agents (~25%) experienced higher utilization. Email (~2%) was the least utilized.
* What don't we know?
  - ...
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
  - ...
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?


### Timeline
See also: [sample discovery sprint schedule](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/sample-discovery-sprint-schedule.md).

* Are there any hard and fast deadlines for completing the discovery work?
* When will the following take place?
  * Discovery Prep: November 6th - November 20th
  * Discovery (ideally 1-2 weeks): November 20th - December 4th
  * User Research: November 27th - December 3rd
  * Complete & Readout: December 4th

## Upon Completion
_To be filled out by the sprint team._

* Lessons learned (about the discovery process)
* Links to key documents (discovery readout, charter, etc.)

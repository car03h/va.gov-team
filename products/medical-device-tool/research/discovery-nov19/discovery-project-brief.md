# Discovery Project Brief & Planning

This doc should be filled out during different stages of the discovery sprint process. See the [Discovery Sprint How-to](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) for details on the whole process.

## PROJECT BRIEF
_To be filled out with a VA.gov lead prior to starting discovery work._

### Project Name
Medical Device Tool

### Problem Statement
Millions of Veterans depend upon the VA for disability-related medical devices and their accessories. Today, Veterans are able to order prosthetic socks and hearing aid batteries, the two most commonly-ordered medical device accessories, through their respective VA forms (Form 2345 & 2346). There are a number of ways to request these medical devices today, through several different mediums and platforms, providing a disparate experience for Veterans. With the expected sunsetting of eBenefits, BAM2 seeks to match and expand the functionality of the platform on the VA.gov website.

#### How Might We...
- ...reduce the effort of re-ordering hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks for Veterans?
- ...increase visibility of orders after they are placed?
- ...ensure that Veterans do not go without the assistive devices and accessories they need?
- ...utilize data we already have to improve benefit utilization?
- ...reduce strain on the DLC call center?

- [x] Create Product Outline ([Link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/product-outline.md))
  - [ ] Define problem, assumed user and business goals, and other assumptions (Product Outline)
  - [ ] Determine POCs, stakeholders, and implementation team (Product Outline)
- [x] Create Discovery Sprint Brief
  - [x] Determine Discovery methods needed
  - [x] Determine user research methods needed
  - [x] Determine what APIs and/or systems to investigate
- [ ] Recruit for stakeholder research

- [ ] Recruit for user research
- [ ] Determine ideal Discovery outputs and artifacts

### Project Details

#### What do we know?
  - There are 5 major ways a Veteran can order resupply items: via phone, mail, email, eBenefits resupply applet, or VHA provider.
  - All DLC orders go through ROES, either by VHA provider, call-center agent, or veteran input in the eBenefits applet.
  - Customer eligibility is determined by a VHA provider placing an initial product order. 
  - Customers are only able to reorder previously-supplied items through eBenefits.
  - Items ordered through mail, phone, or email are cross-referenced with the Veteran's profile for eligibility.
  - Veterans often need assistance with determining which resupply items are needed.
  - The eBenefits platform is currently underutilized in Q4 2019 (~4%) while mail-in form (~49%), live phone agents (~19%), and automated phone agents (~25%) experienced higher utilization. Email (~2%) was the least utilized.
    - [1] A stakeholder noted that inability to use DS Logon is the reason the eBenefits avenue is underutilized. 

#### What don't we know?
  - What are the pain points Veterans are experiencing in this process?
  - Why do Veterans opt for the ordering method that they do?
  - What are the constraints in data we get from the DLC API? 

#### Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
  - [1] Why are Veterans unable or unwilling to utilize eBenefits?

#### How are we going to find out answers? 
  - Stakeholder Interviews:
    - [x] A introduction call with the DLC IT Leadership
    - [ ] An kickoff call with the greater DLC stakeholder group
    - [ ] A stakeholder interview with DLC Customer Service leadership
    - [ ] A stakeholder interview with DLC IT leadership
  - User Interviews:
    - [ ] Request an interview with 6 hearing aid users and 6 prosthetic limb users to source a minimum of 6 total interviews.

#### What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
  - Users will benefit from us solving this problem by 

#### Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
  - DLC IT Leadership
  - DLC IT Engineers
  - DLC Customer Service Leadership
  - DLC Customer Service Representative
  
#### What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
  - Some secondary research has been completed prior to this discovery sprint ([Link to documentation here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/medical-device-tool/research/preliminary-research-notes.md))

#### Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
  - TBD

#### Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
  - Stakeholders initiated on short notice may be difficult to interface with within the sprint.

#### What discovery artifacts will be produced from this sprint?
  - User journey(s)
  - A presentation of findings with suggestion(s) for identified areas of improvement

# DALC Stakeholder Introduction
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
We are meeting today to introduce ourselves, share the goals and scope of our project, and establish a working relationship as we begin the discovery process. We also have a series of questions we’d like to ask, mostly to orient ourselves on how Veterans interact with DALC to place orders; what methods they use to do so, what happens once they do, eligibility requirements, etc.?

#### Outcomes:
We’d like to have as much color to the current state of the world as possible. This will be indicated by capturing answers to questions documented in the conversation guide. Additionally, we’d like to have a sense of which follow-up questions we need to ask, meetings we need to set up, and POCs we need to make contact with.

#### Structure:
- Introductions (3 minutes): All
- Project/Team Overview (3 minutes): Matt
- Medical Device Ordering Procedural Overview (15 minutes): DALC Team

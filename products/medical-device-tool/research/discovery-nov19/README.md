# Medical Device Tool Discovery, November 2019


### Problem Statement
Millions of Veterans depend upon the VA for disability-related medical devices and their accessories. Today, Veterans are able to order prosthetic socks and hearing aid batteries, the two most commonly-ordered medical device accessories, through their respective VA forms (Form 2345 & 2346). There are a number of ways to request these medical devices today, through several different mediums and platforms, providing a disparate experience for Veterans. With the expected sunsetting of eBenefits, BAM2 seeks to match and expand the functionality of the platform on the VA.gov website.

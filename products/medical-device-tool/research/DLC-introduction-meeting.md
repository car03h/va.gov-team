## Agenda

#New Business
Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

# Purpose:
We are meeting today to introduce ourselves, share the goals and scope of our project, and establish a working relationship as we begin the discovery process. We also have a series of questions we’d like to ask, mostly to orient ourselves on how Veterans interact with DALC to place orders; what methods they use to do so, what happens once they do, eligibility requirements, etc.?

# Outcomes:
We’d like to have as much color to the current state of the world as possible. This will be indicated by capturing answers to questions documented in the conversation guide. Additionally, we’d like to have a sense of which follow-up questions we need to ask, meetings we need to set up, and POCs we need to make contact with.

# Structure:
Introductions (3 minutes): All
Project/Team Overview (3 minutes): Matt
Medical Device Ordering Procedural Overview (15 minutes): DALC Team
Open Q&A (20 minutes): BAM2 Team
Next Steps (2 minutes): MattNotes


## Notes:
--
- KQ- vet obtain from the DLC the vet needs to authenticate, how will the vets authenticate the vet so DLC knows who is who
- M-yes VA has authentication mode that is like eBent
	Where does authentication fit in 
	Yes VA does authentication
- KQ- DLC form DALC- name change. Currently our role is a supply chain rule for nationwide we handle supply chain for clinic sources, we have contract with services and make the providable to 
They order it through us for our patient care needs and full them for the items
For certain item if a product has re needs
Audio the audiologist will fit hearing aid and the patient is good but they need an ongoing supply of batteries, Resupply items form us without going back to their provider, provider time for resupply items, Ebent- come in , we have multiply channels phone center, auto phone option , card , and online channel, Eben go simple applet. We know that they are eligible and (hearing aid =has been supplied) we match user with hearing aid and the match the battery with hearing aid device. 
Other items is socks
Controls in place- vet no more the every 5 moths, has a algorithm to determine, we do not allow them to do it on line but they can call call center or go to the provider. We then supply the item. That is what is on the ebenfits right now.
- M-right, H/S are they only to thing that can be requested by eben
- KQ- yes for online. There are high items for hearing add accessory that gets more complicated, sizing and other, like audiologist had ordered different items. They Vet may switch due to sizing and changes, Sometime the vet does not know what they need, and we offer the right item, That happens on the call center but not on line. But is something we may want to look at
- M-was it inherit complexity not available
- KQ- yes
- M- is it time consuming
- KQ-yes
- M-hits submit. Where do they cue at how does it work mailbox?
- KQ-once they submit, it goes int the batching process, get items through the day, send the batch to the Distribution Management Operations. DMO does the packaging and send it out to mail, get to the home
- M-please tell me more about handles the Batch manager how are they interaction with that, computer system list of orders
- KQ- yes I neglected DIT all application are under the oversite of my team
Once request is summited our internal system basic sends the out put to the disruption section in the form of packing slip and ……. They have all the order informant and ship labels processed as they process and page the order. So they are access the internal systems. We have our system integrated with UPS world shipping, the records and the paging in available on the screen
- M-that make a lot of scene, tell me,=…. You mentioned that you assumed eligibly how it eligible determining, 1 time to on going
- KQ- any order for paten car / any care being provided by the medical center the audiology, VA hometell, they order patient care items , so when they do that that creates a patient record in our system and that constitutes the patient to receive the product and service from use, once the in our system if a vet wants it we check our data base, we only fill order if a va provider has 
- M- only if they are in the system
Asking to approve system and flow
- KQ- no we do not look to another system all the parent records we receive come from the vhr if a provider launches from a medical center, we user that to establish the patient and match it up.
- M- you have an integration with vista
- KQ-yes
- M- is it far to say the first order will not be by a vet it will be a provider form VHR
Dr- 
- M-can you give me a scene that there are 4 different methods call center, and system, blue cards and eben, do you have a sense of the volume
- KQ_ I do track on a Q base So we got some # 4Q 2019, received mail in- 80th, online- 7,800, call center adj 31,000 calls center auto- 40,000, vet can email- 3,000. \
- M- why is mail in so much higher
- KQ – surprisingly but Dr will hand out a stack of cards for the patient and patient have conti to use the cards. The online account it would be high but a main reason it is not exist because of what we thought it would be DL authentication was road block.,
- M- Yes, I can image, is login in something is important, should that be a hurdle
In your mind in an ideal world, inherent risk. It sounds like you guys check anyways
Not logging in is similar to not logging in. 
Joseph- Questions. Are the post cards returned with the supply with the order, probly so?
- KQ- probly so. Fresh card in the bag
- J-a URL in stead of 
- KQ- Vet get both URL and refresh cared
- J- Dos it have a pre-stamped 
- KQ-it is not because we do ask for name and last four, it need to be sent back in an envelope
- JB- thank you
- M-how does it change the process from send it as paper then other
Does paper change the work load?
- KQ_ online order it process through the system manual, the cards first thing is they get scanned the information is takin off it. If we can match the info to vet, then we use an auto system. If not, the Center person enter the card manual int the system
- M- thank you. Andy other questions
- Amen- Trying to get the system architect down. As we migrate from eben to VA who would we talk to about that. 
- KQ- Not user about ??
- M- when someone hit CTA what happen what serves are involved trying to figure out who
- A-	Thanks matt
- KQ- yeah that would be my team. Because this is situation where Eben send something to it the Applet that is in Eben it our system. I frame. So, when vets hit CTA it’s us
- M-is it a Mums
- KQ- yes, some mums in the background and then our layer sit on it. 
- M- a few minutes left, next steps
What is the best way to learn more about the items, doc or follow up meeting a more in-depth walk through, what do you recommend?
- KQ- do another section and we can walk through what it currently looks like and what happens on the backend and what it looks on our sides. If that is helpful
- M- that would be very helpful for our team.  N and I can schedule, I think you have a 100 foot about migrate, who else should we talk to about pitfalls, beyond you and your team.
- KQ- chief of our customer service dev. He is a customer and business stand point. Overall call sent functionality, and add to our business 
- Jb- is it desired to reduce Human interaction or call center orders. Are we trying to shift order to automation?
- KQ- it is desirable, Center is finite resource. They are ok with the current load they have, I can share with you on the radar, we are in the process =in adding new products and services , supply chain for Sleep apnea care, resupply needs, all of these same channels we know that work load is coming we want to optimize channels . 
- JB- call center 7,000 hits for online, is there a different system for the internal order
- KQ- Call center inhouse application for call on the phone or reapplications for provider ROES that is the clinician facing application VHA (a few groups) 
- JB- Amen and I would be looking at API’s 
- B-ROES is the clinical, but vets can log in it
- KQ- the Vet applicate is different then roes but vet and ROES same data point in the backend but eben for the Vet
- B-thank you that was complexing me
- M-Awesome, I think there will be a few follow-up meetings. With KQ and your team
- KQ- that sounds good, we did not hear about anything about this. this has got us off guard and it good to know but I need to address this at a stand point about what is need and diverting resources and scheduling to be available. To move forward on this. 
- M-Yes great that was one thing was thought, we would like to set up a more 
More considerate of your time
- KQ_ we are looing forward to get the integration going and we are excited

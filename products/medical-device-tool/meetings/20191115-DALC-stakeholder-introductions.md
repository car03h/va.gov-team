# DALC Stakeholder Introduction
## Agenda:

#### Attendees: 
Matthew Self, Nick Wygonik, Riley Orr, Rebecca Walsh, Amen Ra, Mahariel Rosario, Joseph Brothers, DALC Stakeholder

#### Background:
Our team, Benefits & Memorials 2, is working on modernizing the digital mechanism Veterans use to order medical devices. Practically, this means working with Veterans to design and launch a new ordering mechanism on the VA.gov platform.

#### Purpose:
We are meeting today to introduce ourselves, share the goals and scope of our project, and establish a working relationship as we begin the discovery process. We also have a series of questions we’d like to ask, mostly to orient ourselves on how Veterans interact with DALC to place orders; what methods they use to do so, what happens once they do, eligibility requirements, etc.?

#### Outcomes:
We’d like to have as much color to the current state of the world as possible. This will be indicated by capturing answers to questions documented in the conversation guide. Additionally, we’d like to have a sense of which follow-up questions we need to ask, meetings we need to set up, and POCs we need to make contact with.

#### Structure:
- Introductions (3 minutes): All
- Project/Team Overview (3 minutes): Matt
- Medical Device Ordering Procedural Overview (15 minutes): DALC Team
- Open Q&A (20 minutes): BAM2 Team
- Next Steps (2 minutes): Matt

## Questions:
- [ ] What are some of the problems the DALC is experiencing in regards to hearing aid / prosthetic sock ordering? 
- [ ] What are the problems you’re seeing veterans experience when ordering? 
- [x] Are veterans able to adjust their own orders or do new orders require VA healthcare providers ‘prescribing’ the items?
- [ ] What risks or problems do you see us facing during this project? 
- [x] Are there any other medical devices that have demand high enough for inclusion? 
- [ ] How can we access the most up-to-date version of VA forms 2345 and 2346? 
- [ ] What are some ways you think the ordering process could be improved for Veterans? 
- [x] Is there anyone else you think we should talk to about this project? 
- [ ] How would you prefer us to continue engaging with you and other DALC employees going forward? 
- [x] Articulate the different use cases of ROES and eBenefits for ordering; do they cross paths at any point along the application-submission-fulfillment pipeline? 
- [x] Who is eligible? How is eligibility initially determined and checked on an ongoing basis?
- [x] How many orders do you receive from each source? For how many people? 
- [ ] Are most people repeat users? Ordering the same thing, or different combinations of things each time? 
- [x] We’ve heard there is a catalog of things beyond batteries and prosthetic socks; is this true? Is this catalog available to order via eBenefits? 
- [ ] Are Veterans the only ones eligible to order? What about spouses/dependents?
- [x] What can you tell us about how the data is being submitted? 
- [x] Where does submission data coming from eBenefits get stored? 
- [x] What system(s) do DALC staff use to process requests? 
- [x] How do paper orders get handled and tracked alongside digital orders?


## Notes:

### Riley's Notes

Stakeholder: One of my questions I’ll ask up front, in order for the Veterans to order these tools they need to authenticate. How will a Veteran authenticate to the system so we know who they are?

Facilitator: VA.gov is a platform that has an authenticated experience. We use the same login credentials as eBenefits. We also have additional credentials healthevet etc… We have the same and an expanded authentication model. We’re really coming at this eyes wide open. How does authentication play in?

Stakeholder: So let me back up a little bit then. The DLC is the Denver Logistics Center. Formerly called the DALC. There’s been a name change as of a couple of years ago. We handle supply chain for certain product lines. We have contracts in place with commercial vendors for those products and we make the products available for the VHA provider, clinical provider, community. Clinicials within those particular services can order the products and services through us for their patient care. We do the supply chain order fulfillment. For certain products if an item has been ordered, there might be ongoing resupply needs. The best example is the audiology program. A clinician will do a hearing test for a patient and order a hearing aid for the patient. They will fit the aid to the patient. They may need an ongoing supply of batteries for their aid. Veterans can order from us so they don’t have to go back to their provider. That’s where eBenefits comes in. We have multiple channels by which a Veteran can request: call center, automated phone system, mail in a pre-printed postal card that we provide, and online channels. If they need replacement hearing aid batteries they can go to eBenefits. They can indicate that they need a resupply. We already know that they are eligible by virtue of the fact that VA has issued a hearing aid to them. We just do a match that the battery they are ordering is one of the batteries that matches with the particular hearing aid model that they have. They enter their request and then we ship out the batteries to them. The other product currently available is prosthetic socks. They can reorder a supply of stump socks as needed so they can have that supply on hand. We do have certain controls in place: if a Veteran requests batteries, they are allowed to request no more often than 5 months. There is an algorithm that determined that the batteries supplied should last that long if not longer. If they were to request batteries sooner, we do not allow them to do it online but we do refer them to the call center or provider. Aside from that, as long as the interval between requests is appropriate then we provide the batteries to them. That’s the nature of the capability that’s on eBenefits right now. It sounds like essentially you are looking at porting that over to VA.gov environment 

Facilitator: You gave us the two use cases that are somewhat familiar to us. Are those the only things the Veteran can order through eBenefits portal?

Stakeholder: Those are the only two things that can be requested through the eBenefits portal. One of our other high volume resupply categories is hearing aid accessories. There are a number of hearing aid accessories that need to be replaced on a regular basis. That gets complicated because there are sizing factors and over the course of the hearing aid cycle the audiologist may have ordered a certain set of accessories along with the hearing aid order but after fitting and making adjustments they may switch to a different sizing or accessory item. So sometimes it’s difficult for a Veteran to know what to request, so we rely on our records but that works much better when they contact the call center or contact us through those channels to make sure they get the right item. We haven’t pursued that for online request but it may be something we want to look at as we move forward.

Facilitator: That makes a lot of sense. Is it fair to say that this capability hadn’t been put on eBenefits because of its inherent complexity or another reason?

Stakeholder: That is correct.

Facilitator: That does sound like it is high-volume and time-intensive for you to walk through and find the right thing?

Stakeholder: It can be, yes

Facilitator: If you’re able to, can you tell me a little bit about what happens after the request is submitted through eBenefits? How you verify, etc?

Stakeholder: Once they submit, then that order goes into our batching process. We accumulate those requests throughout the day. At periodic times throughout the day we send those requests to our distribution management operation and they are processed, do the packaging and shipment, and get them into the mainstream for delivery to go to the Veteran’s homes.

Facilitator: Tell me more about the batch processing. How does the distribution management operation interact with the orders?

Stakeholder: Once the request is submitted, they send the output to the distribution section in the form of packing slips, summary sheets that help them for picking purposes, and so they got all of the order information, shipping labels are printed as they’re processing the orders, so they’re going through the records in the batch one-by-one and processing that order, doing the packaging, and getting them into the delivery stream. So they’re accessing our internal systems. We have our internal systems integrated with UPS and the batches/records are available on the screen and through the printed packs/mailing slips 

Facilitator: That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned that it sounds like you guys assume eligibility based on the fact that someone has sent an order previously. Tell me more about how eligibility is determined and how it’s checked.

Stakeholder: Yeah, any orders for patient care purposes… any care being provided for patient care purposes originates from the provider at the medical center. It could be audiologist at hearing aid program. We also deal with telehealth program. They’re the ones who initially order whatever patient care products they need for the patients they’re seeing. When they do that, that creates a patient record in our system. Essentially, that constitutes the authorization for the patient to receive products and services from us. Once that record is in our system, if a Veteran requests directly themselves the first thing we do is check to see that they’re in our database. If not, then that means that they never received anything from their provider so we don’t fulfill those. We can only fulfill orders for patients within our system 

Facilitator: So you check in the database that the patient exists. You receive a batch of records, you get them in a queue, you pull it and look in another system to verify that the same patient exists. Is that right?

Stakeholder: Well, no we don’t really look in another system. All of the patient records we receive come from the medical record system. When an application session is launched from a medical center, it brings that patient information with it. We use that to establish patient record. We can match it up. 

Facilitator: So you have an integration with Vista?

Stakeholder: Yes, in a sense. 

Facilitator: Gotcha, so in a sense it’s safe to assume that a Veteran will never submit the first order?

Stakeholder: Yes, that is correct.

Facilitator: The first order is always initiated from a provider direct from the EHR. Once every 5 months the Veteran can log into eBenefits, submit it, they’ll be logged in so you’ll get their credential. You verify the Veteran exists, and proceed?

Stakeholder: Correct

Facilitator: I think I made note of four different methods that people can use to submit reorders: call centers, automated phone system, pre-printed cards (blue cards), and eBenefits. Do you have a sense what the volume for each of those is? 

Stakeholder: I do, I actually track that fairly closely on a quarterly basis. So, we’ve got… let’s see… so here are some numbers for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019: mailing cards (80000) online orders (7800) calls to call center that were answered by an agent (31000) and calls to the call center that opted into the automated battery request like (little over 40000), and one more channel where a Veteran can contact call center via email which we prefer they don’t (3000) 

Facilitator: Why is that one so much higher than the others?

Stakeholder: Surprisingly, it’s a fairly popular means for Veterans to request their products from us. A lot of the clinics will inform them of the channels and make them aware of the online ordering, form number, etc and they will hand a stack of cards to the patient. For whatever reason the patients have continued to use the mailing cards on a prevalent basis. The online ordering count is, ya know we have higher hopes that this number would be higher in terms of orders coming in. A reason we know it hasn’t escalated is because of the authentification process and Veterans finding it difficult to obtain a DS(?) logon credential in the first place. 

Facilitator: I can imagine. Let me dive into that a little bit. Is logging in something that you believe is important? Should that be a hurdle to submit reorder? Is there enough inherent risk if they don’t since you check anyways? Not logging in would be the same as sending post-card.

Stakeholder: It is important to know the identify the person making the request to prevent fraud… (Interrupted and lost track of notes for a second)

Facilitator: How does it change the process when someone sends paper vs sending digitally? 

Stakeholder: When an online request comes in, there’s no manual intervention that’s needed in order to fulfill the order. For the cards that come in the first thing we do is run them through a scanning process. The cards are scanned and the information is taken off there. If we can match the patient identity from the card then we will also process that order in an automated fashion other than the person scanning the cards themselves. The ones that can’t be fed through then the information is taken off the card. There’s a few manual steps for entering that information into our system 

Team member: I’m trying to get the system architecture down. As we’re migrating from eBenefits to VA.gov and getting data sources down, who would we talk to about that?

Stakeholder: Not exactly sure of your question.

Facilitator: We want to understand when someone submits a request, what are the endpoints?

Stakeholder: That would be my team because this isn’t a situation where the order is being entered into eBenefits and eBenefits is transmitting it. It’s an iFrame in our system 

Facilitator: How can we learn more? Is there documentation? An in-depth walkthrough 

Stakeholder: Probably to do another session. I can bring a few more people in and we can walk through what it currently looks like in eBenefits from start to finish. What happens on the backend and what it looks like on our side. 

Facilitator: You have a 30,000 foot of what we’re trying to do. What else, or who else do you think would behoove us to talk to on your team or other teams? 

Stakeholder: In this next session one of the folks I would plan to bring in is chief of customer service. He oversees call service and should be part of the conversation as well. We can speak from the IT and business standpoint. He’s really the one who is responsible for the overall call center functionality. He would add to the business interests in that standpoint. 

Stakeholder: We are in the process of expanding and adding product lines and adding product supply support. One of the ones on the horizon is a supply chain for the VA’s apnea care. We’ll be doing the CPAP needs and have masks, tubing, things like that. Once that product line is operational, all of these same channels will be supporting resupply for these masks. Knowing that workload is coming we are definitely wanting to make sure we optimize and maximize the channels so we don’t overwhelm the call center. 

Team member: Last question about the call center, what do call center folks using?

Stakeholder: Call center folks use in-house application that my team is responsible for. When they’re processing calls on the phone, they’re using that application to enter the information. For providers, there’s an application that we wrote called, “ROES” 

Team member: You mentioned ROES is the clinical facing. We found out Veterans can log in. Is that true?

Stakeholder: What you found is a misrepresentation. The Veteran-facing application we consider to be different and separate from ROES. Orders coming from ROES and from Veterans go into the same system backend. It’s more accurate to consider ROES to be clinician facing and eBenefits to be Veteran-facing.

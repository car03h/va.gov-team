# Blue Water Navy Veterans - Identifiers

Previous VA position: Blue Water Navy veterans if you were in the coastal waters of Vietnam you weren’t exposed to Agent Orange b/c it wasn’t sprayed that far out into the water.

Veteran position: There’s got to be some correlation. Winds could take the spray out into the water. VA’s stance was that there was no correlation. Inland waterway, river or delta=brown water were considered exposed. Lot of legislation over the last year and a lot of support to extend benefits to Blue Water Navy veterans.

Blue Water is hot up to the secretary level and beyond. We need to start processing the claims. Blue Water Navy veterans if you were in the coastal waters of Vietnam you weren’t exposed to Agent Orange b/c it wasn’t sprayed that far out into the water.

Ask specific question for Vietnam era veteran who served in the Navy, these conditions are considered presumptive if you were exposed to Agent Orange (if you were within 12 nautical miles of Vitenam). Once they self-identify we could

Vietnam Navy, Marines, other service branches If within Feb 28, 1961 - May 7, 1975 (Paul has to verify the dates)—> Did you serve in Vietnam —> presumptive conditions (20+)

BWN wasn’t an avenue to entitlement in the past, now it is. When a veteran files the claim, the onus is on the regional office to identify the eligibility and develop the case to support the avenues of entitlement. It’s very easy for someone to receive a claim and overlook the evidence to support this avenue of entitlement. Potential for claim to be decided without connection to presumptive conditions. A senior adjudicator might find it. As early as possible if we can identify the veteran as a potential blue water navy veteran we can ensure we do the proper development to give a timely decision. What ship we’re you on, review deck logs based on long and lat coordinates were you within 12mi radius. If it takes 60 days to flag the case and then it could take 60-90 days to gather records. We can initiate evidence gathering

For the agency because it’s a hot button topic. This could highlight the potential to build out functionality in months. Wants an opportunity to provide a tangible example. We can do things faster and more accurately.

Original Claims: 400,000/yr BDD: 50,000/yr changes will make it 250,000 but service members wouldn’t need to initiate the process. DoD will notify VA instead. Can possibly leverage the claim status page

BWN Est population: about 100,000/yr 8940 4192

When we tie that selection to the claimed disability; might be nice that veteran can select disabilities from the list. Then we’d want to assign a unique attribute that comes over when we pass the contention. Can we assign a special issue at claims establishment?

Flashes at the veteran Special issues at contention level (Paul)

Paul would need to work on the VBA side to build that attribute and we’d need to determine whether we can assign it

# Session 6, Oct 1, 10am

# Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kevin and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov.

• Okay.

*Before we start, a few things I want to mention:*
	• *This entire session should take about 45 minutes.* I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

	• *In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.* We are not testing your ability. In reality, we're testing ourselves. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

	• *During part of our session today, you'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool.* The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

	• *If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.*

	• *Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?* We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	• Yeah, that’s fine

		• If yes: *Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.*

/Start recording./

*I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?*
Yes.

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - (5-10 minutes)
Before we look at the VA website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

Tell me a little about yourself. (Where do you live? Which branch of service? What do you do for work?)
	• Sure. I live in Stafford VA right now. I was in the Marine Corps for six years..

Have you ever filed a disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
	• I have.

How did you file it (online, mail, fax, VSO)?
	• Um, I submitted it online through e-benefits first, and then I did a supplemental that was faxed. 

How did you feel about the process?
	• With my initial claim, I feel like there wasn’t as much communication as I would like. I was going abroad…
	• And the process went ahead automatically while I was gone. And resulted in my claim being denied, and that caused me to submit the supplemental claim. So the second round was much better.

Have you ever filed an appeal with the Department of Veteran Affairs
	• Yes. Because I submitted the supplemental

How did you go about filing it?
	•  

How did you feel about the process?
	• Really good. It went really smoothly. The third party who helped me—I was working with LHI—and they in a matter of a month, I got an answer saying they received everything and were ready to schedule me. They schedule me to go over everything within two weeks from that phone call and it processed within a week and a half.

# Setup Task: Share your screen with Zoom - (5 minutes)
Please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.
Navigate to va.gov in your computer's browser.
Click the "Share" on Zoom.


## First Task: Show me where you would expect to file an appeal (on a disability claim decision)?
Start on the home page of VA.gov.

• I think it’s over here somewhere [hovering over disability]
• [clicks on How To File A Claim]
• I mean it’s good information, but what I would like to see is a button like this [file a claim]  up at the time
• All the information about getting ready to file the claim is good.
• But I just think there is a difference between an information page and an action page. This one is kind of both. And that’s not that clear.
• Since there are three different things—initial claim, supplemental, and appeal—and it would good to have those three buttons on the same page. So it’s a little clearer what process your starting by what button you push.
• This looks like it’s just for your initial claim. I don’t see anything for an appeal
• [return to homepage]  Maybe uploading evidence? This one says Check Your Status,  but I assume that’s for your initial claim
• [on upload evidence page] Again, this is good information. I mean it’s all good information, but I’m not sure if I want to upload my information I don’t think I’d want so much information as much as a button to upload my evidence.
• Just here at the bottom “Learn more” which I assume would take me to another information page, not an action page
• In describing what you need to do and what paperwork you need is good, but the action part is not clear.
• [expectations of “learn more about filing an appeal”] what constitutes an appeal. What you should have ready. Where it’s going to go, who’s going to look at it.
	• [on the page] Yeah this is what I would say I was expecting to see. I think if it was more, the instructions were more direct. Like if you’re filing direct. It doesn’t, to me, make it glaringly obvious how you’re going to do that.

# Second Task: Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the chat. Can you click on it?
(https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/S2U2NQZZ76A#/385489667_Intro-Page-2)

## 1st screen: Claim Status Tool
/Can you take a few moments to look at this screen and tell me about what you think you can do on this page?/
• Yep, so this is pretty good. It has each individually filing that you would have submitted separately. It tells you whether it’s received and what the status of it. 
• I know in my case, I didn’t feel confident in the status that I was being told. But the fact that it’s being offered there and if it’s accurate then that’s great.
• I guess the View Status button gives you more information, maybe let’s you view the documents that were submitted with the form
• It’s very direct and obvious. I like this “Find out why we sometimes combine claims” because if I submitted 4 claims but I’m only seeing 3 I might wonder what happened, and boom I can learn why.
• If it’s a closed claim, I might want to see the status of it. 

## 2nd screen: Open Claim Details
Take a few moments to look at this screen. 
• This looks really good. It gives a full checklist of the process, and where you are in the claim. I like the estimated date, that’s helpful. I know I don’t need to do anything until that estimated date has come and gone

/Is there anything that you think you need to do regarding your claim?/
• 

/What do you think you'll see on the Files tab?/
• Everything that I have submitted for this claim. So I can make sure that everything I submitted, actually made it to the process

/Go ahead and click on it./

## 3rd screen: Open Claim Details > File tab

/What would you do here?/
• It’s good that File Requests is on the top. That’s the most important. 
• And these are good, this just shows everything I did submit and the name of the document, so that’s good

/What is most helpful about this page?/
• This is clear, this is good

/Let's say you had more files to submit for this claim. What would you do next?/
• I would click on the view details button. There might more information on what constitutes as evidence before you start submitting whatever files you’ve got


## 4th screen: Open Claim Details > File Tab > Add File
Is this what you'd expect to see?
Is it clear what actions you are able to take on this page?
Click on the 'add file' button. For the purposes of this session, let's assume you've uploaded the document you see here and have chosen the correct file details (in this case, Military Personnel Record). What might you do next?
• This page kind of assumes what documents count for their situation. They probably have some literature or some information from the website about what they need. That would be good here
• Having an option for people who don’t do things online, is good.
• Maybe a link about what constitutes as evidence

/What do you think that checkbox means?/
• It means that I shouldn’t be submitting anything that doesn’t apply to the claim, and that by checking this I am submitting documents relevant to my claim
• I will say, the wording for some might be a little confusing. Because it’s almost a double negative. I can see how that might be confusing for people. 
• To the lowest common denominator, it’s not clear enough
• By the time you get to the bottom of the page, I don’t think there is anything you need to add to make it clearer.

Click 'submit files for review'.

## 5th screen: Open Claim Details > File Tab - Status Detail (submission state)
/What would you expect to see after you click submit?/

/What is most helpful about this page?/
• It worked! So that’s good. 

# Post-Task Interview
/Do you have any other feedback to share with us today?/
• I just want to reiterate from my point earlier. When I needed to submit a supplemental claim, I really want to be able to do it online, and I couldn’t. 

# Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

For your participation, you'll receive a check from Perigean, the company that recruited for this study, within two weeks. If you don't receive it, please contact _____.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
• “I am going to a minority veteran summit Saturday and Sunday, so I can for sure share the information with folks there.”

If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Layla's Notes

### Have you ever filed a disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?
Um. My wife would be better to ask. I filed one way back. About 15 years ago. I recently filed one that I was very pleased with. The doctor was outstanding. The way things moved, it was very smooth compared to our first one.

### How did you file it (online, mail, fax, VSO)?

- The first one I don’t know.

- The second one, you got to MHV or eBenefits and we requested a compensation exam because I was getting worse.

### How did you feel about the process?

- Surprisingly, it was very simple. When I was in TX I had to be represented by the Parayzed Vets Assoocaiteion. It was very discouraged for you to file it by yourself. You had to get someone to represent you.

- Have you ever filed an appeal with the Department of Veteran Affairs

- No. The first one. I just let it go. They had it at 100% and then moved it to 90%. And then they gave me 100% unemployablity. It wasn’t the truth about it and I just let it be.

- On this one, I don’t need to do an appeal unless you know something I don’t know.

### First Task: Show me where you would expect to file an appeal (on a disability claim decision)?

- Opens Internet Explorer.

- Searches for VA.gov, clicks on search result.

- Maximizes screen.

P1: Okay, so you want me to x out of it?
My question is, does this have anything to do with me or is this a broad question for everybody.

*Reads…*

P1: I would think it would be under Disability. File claim or appeal status. But it doesn’t say anything about filing an appeal.

I’m just an old retired brain injured guy, but that’s where I would go.

Kevin: How would you file an appeal.

I’ll be honest with you, it really 50/50 because file a claim for pension is the initial thing to do. It doesn’t tell me. Just guessing, I’d click on Check your claim or appeal status. It’s not spelling it out for me. 

Kevin: What if we click on How to file a claim

*Reads page…scrolls…*

P1: Excuse my language. You know I’m a Vet. Dude. This is telling me jackend sh** about filing an appeal. That’s just how Vets talk. If you’re offended, I apologize. This is giving me know reference about how to file an appeal. 

*Reads…*

P1: You know what happens after I file my disability claims, that would be a good thing, appeals maybe.

There’s nothing out there that remotely even… forget screaming at you. Nothing is even hinting at you as an option. It’s almost as if it doesn’t exist.

Kevin: Scroll down a bit…You mentioned after you file your claim.

P1: What happens after I send my claim...reads…

Okay. What happens if your claim is denied? It has nothing. Maybe there should be “after you file your claim, what are your options?”

*Kevin shares a link to the prototype. Trouble getting P1 to see the chat.*

*Kevin shares his screen.*

P1: Beautiful!

Kevin: This is the Claim Status Tool on VA.gov. Can you take a few moments to look at the screen and tell me what you see.
Oh, I like that. Additional services. That’s very good. 

The fact that you can actually get help to file claims or appeals. That’s very important. My only deal. My 2 cents pointing this out. It’s under something. Appeals are a big thing. We know that. If you really want people to start people to do them, you have to bite the bullet and say Claim and Appeals. In can’t be under a past subject. Even additional services is great, but alot of these guys have lost memories. I’m blind in one eye and have trouble in the other. It’s hard for me to read regular print. The bold, the underline. That’s what I look at for subjects.

Kevin: How do you think you’d see the most recent detail of the dependency claim.

P1: I like it. My dad had to go through that. View status. Beautiful. Excuse me for being ignorant, but can you do claims for dependency?

This is the first time I’ve seen claims for dependency.

I would expect for lack of a better term, the military is all about the appendix, annex this, reference that. For something like this, it gives me a View status. If I want more information. It hints to it. I get it. I guess I’d like to see more than a view status. I would also like to see information on that subject right underneath it.

Kevin: What you might expect to see if you clicked the View Status button?

P1: What’s the expected timeline, point of contact, when am I gonna be contacted or if they’re expecting me to contact them. 

*Kevin opens View Status page.*

P1: That’s what I’m getting at … reads page.

I’m just saying, you know, is there away for me to contact and see if this is the best number you can reach. Maybe I’ve switched doctors or maybe my wife has power of attorney. A lot of my buddies have done claims and they’re counting down the days. If gets more than the estimated time, they’re thinking they’re automatically gonna be denied. 

It’s cut and dry. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not stepping backward. I’ve been in Washington DC and worked on projects that I can’t name. I’m not here to attack what you’re doing. And to give the best advice from my perspective and hope it works out. I do have a rusty voice, I apologize. I’m trying to give feedback the best that I can. The people that I know, the constant Vets I know, because I’m very big on talking with the Vets community.

*Kevin prompts scenario for adding a file.*

P1: I would call the 800 number under Need Help and pray to God it’s more than they can help me. Hoping that they would have something to say if you’re adding to a claim and press a number. Hopefully, I’d have a claim file to reference. It would be more beneficial … on number 3, it’s telling me. My dad’s German and saying you will go on vacation and you will have fun. 

*Kevin navigates to File tab.*

P1: Man, I feel like a dumbass now. Additional evidence. That’s beautiful.

I would View the Details. It gives me hope that it says Upload it here.

Kevin: Is this what you would expect?

P1: Absolutely.

*Kevin clicks through to adding a file screen.*

Kevin: Is that clear that you’ve added a file?

P1: Absolutely. I like that you put the accepted file type. We don’t like to be ordered around, but things put in so that we know the guidelines. 

Kevin: What would you do next?

P1: Well, obviously, I’d go and click the checkbox. That’s a disclosure and also the understanding.

Kevin: Is that clear (checkbox) verbage?

P1: It could not be any clearer, brother!

*Kevin clicks button, prototype advances*

Kevin: Is this page what you’d expect?

P1: Absolutely. If it’s not clear you think the VA is giving you the runaround. Perception is reality and if you make it more clear, I think the way the VA is viewed by Veterans and civilians will be swayed. That’s out it starts. 

Kevin wraps up.

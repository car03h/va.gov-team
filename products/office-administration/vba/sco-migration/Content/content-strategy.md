# School Resources Page Content Strategy


## Page Type:  Hub

Mockup/Example: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7

**Page Purpose/Intent:**
- Serves as a key landing page. Provides content and links to help users understand what information is available in that section.  

### Components

**Page Title:**
Name of the area. Each area includes a unique icon that represents the benefit.  

**Intro Text:**
Brief description of content on the page.

**On This Page:**
Jump links to each of the spokes. 

**Crisis Callout:**
Only used when there is a critical call-out needed for the hub.  Primarily used for homeless or mental health services. Not used on all hubs. <- OMIT entirely or will they be able to use callouts?

**Spokes:**
- A sub-grouping of pages/links/accordions.   
- There should be no more than 4 spokes.
- There should be a max of 6 accordions in each spoke.  

*SCO Hub*
- The spokes on the School Resources page are: Training & Guides; Upcoming events; and Policies and procedures
- "Resources to support students" can become a spoke if more than 8 links need to be displayed.

*Announcements*
- Displays the 3 most recent announcements.  These announcements are also displayed on the Breaking News page. 
- Announcements may include links to resources that reside in their permanent location.

*Within each spoke* 
- Content and links are placed within accordions
- What is the rhyme or reason for when links are categorized beneath a sub-heading and when they are not?
- Hyperlinks are either underlined and unbold or bold, not underlined with a chevron. 

*Training and guides spoke*
- The Essentials for School Certifying Officials accordion is designed to contain links that SCOs acccess frequently and resources that new SCO need as they begin the onboarding process.
- The VA-ONCE accordion is designed to contain all resources related to VA-ONCE.
- The Payments and debt accordion is designed to contain a resources related to payments and debt.

**Crosslinking:**
- Any guidelines here?


**Promo Spot:**  
- Call-out to key content or service directly related to the benefit hub.  
- Same promo that is also displayed in the top nav.
- Should not lead user off VA.gov
- Must be SCO or School Administrator content

**Ask Questions:**
- Includes link to Iris as well as other key contact numbers for Veterans for that benefit area that are for getting assistance with applying for and managing the benefits in the hub.

**Not a Veteran:**
- Not required for all benefit hubs.
- Includes links to content areas for other audiences/personas served by that benefit/administration. 
- Links should be audience/persona based, not links to single/specific forms or documents.  Ideally we would link to a landing page that can provide information on what is available to that audience/persona or describe the form/document and then link to it.  

**Connect with Us:**

- Primary link is the the Administration that owns the benefit area.

# School Resources Page Content Strategy


### Overview

The new School Resources Page (https://tbd) is based on the VA.gov Hub page template.

**Page Template:**
- Hub Page Template: https://app.moqups.com/Rnc4BDEKrA/view/page/a8b9b0da7

**Page Purpose/Intent:**
- Serves as a key landing page. Provides content and links to help users understand what information is available in the section.  

### Components

**Page Title:**
Name of the area. Each area includes a unique icon that represents the benefit.  

**Intro Text:**
Brief description of content on the page.

**On This Page:**
Jump links to each of the spokes. 

**Critical Callout:**
Future functionality: Once the Pages is migrated into Drupal, it may be possible to leverge the Critical Callout element.  The Critical Callout only appears when a critical call-out needed for the hub.  On Beneficiary-focused hub pages, the call is primarily used for homeless or mental health services. It is not used on all hubs. Futher discussions with DSVA will be needed before this element is leveraged.

**Announcements**
- Displays the 3 most recent announcements.  
- These announcements are also displayed on the Breaking News page. 
- Announcements may include links to resources that reside in their permanent location.

**Spokes:**
- Spokes are a sub-grouping of pages/links/accordions.   
- There should be no more than 4 spokes.
- There should be a max of 6 accordions in each spoke.  
- The spokes on the School Resources page are: 
  - Training & Guides
  - Upcoming events

### Potential Learn & Improve Research Questions

* Would users benefit from continuing to optimize longer labels to improve how scannable they are?

Forms
* How frequently are forms used? Freqently enough that "Forms" would be a useful addition to "Key Resources", rather than having it appear below the fold?
* Is there value in having Forms on the same HTML page as Brochures and Factsheets? If they are frequently accessed independently, would users expect to see Factsheets and brochures in the GI Bill Benefits and Program area?
* Would users benefit from a description under the Forms & Factsheets link?

Policies & procedures
* Do users see the process for GI Bill program approval as a how to/procedure? If so, should it be placed at the top with other how to/procedure links?
* If there is only one procedure in the Policies and Procedures section (how to obtain GI Bill program approval), should procedure be plural? Should the Policies & Procedures section become "GI Bill Policies and Programs"?
* Which additional education programs and benefits could we include within the GI BIll Benefits and Programs accordion? Which could be removed?


User engagement
* Are users engaging with the Key Resource links? 
* Are users opening accordions and engaging with the content there? 
* What's the most used content on the page (aside from SCO Handbook)? 
* How do users compare this page to the pages that were replaced? 
* Are the CA SCOs able to find the SAA info they need? 


### Potential Enhancements

* Updating the date display for easier scanning & better comprehension

### Activities & Inputs
- Determine if there is a way to track analytics on a page hosted in GitHub. 
   - Yes.  This can be tracked.  

- Let SCOs know how they can provide feedback on the new page when it's launched, so we'll have user feedback for the Learn & Improve phase.

- Consider mechanisms for broader information collection 
  - Survey or other info collection
  - In-person testing @ conference 
  - Front Range Colorado Conference, Jan 15-16
  - TAPVCO (Texas Association of Collegiate Veteran Program Officials), March 2020

- Onboarding/training
    - [Onboarding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/wiki/VA.gov-Onboarding)
- Content processes
    - [Content Review process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Content/content-review-process.md)
    - [VA content owner requests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/guides/content-update-form-process.md) [this links to a process that's partially outdated; also CURF - is that the jotform requests?/ jen]
    - [URL creation and process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Information%20Architecture/URL%20Creation%20Process%20and%20Guidelines.md)
    - [Web content templates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/tree/master/templates-and-guides/web-content-templates) [this appears outdated]
    - [Content process for modernizing VA forms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/guides/content-VA-form-process.md) [points to 404]
- VA.gov content style guide and strategy guides ["style guide" spelling style]
    - [VA.gov content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) [change to "style guide" - we had to pick 1 spelling style and that's where we landed]
    - [Edit files - VA.gov content style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/tree/master/src/_content-style-guide) [changed the link name here - this is the edit files - don't think it belongs on an onboarding checklist though. Please remove it from this context.]
    - [Terms to lowercase (these aren't proper nouns)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/list-of-terms-to-lowercase.md) [All of these terms - if they're important on VA.gov - should already be incorporated on the ^ content style guide > word list. I think it's confusing to have similar/slightly different/kind of duplicate info, so I recommend archiving/retiring this. Maybe have Randi or one of the new content ppl to do a check to make sure all of these terms have been captured in the style guide.]
    - [Content strategy guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content-style-guide/blob/master/Content-Strategy-Document/Table%20of%20Contents.md) [this also looks outdated - archive or label 'history' or the like]
    - [Error messaging dictionary styleguide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Platform/Design%20System/Guidelines/Error%20handling/Dictionary.md)
    - [Error message standardization styleguide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Platform/Design%20System/Guidelines/Error%20handling/Content%20Style%20Guide.md)
    - [Form label masterlist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/site-wide-issues/Form%20label%20masterlist.xlsx) 
- Content team checklists    
    - [Content launch checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/checklists/new-content-launch.md) [I like the idea of a content launch checklist, but I think this list is somewhat outdated and therefore could confuse new ppl who don't know what's legacy, no longer valid, what still applies. Can we update the list, and for now, should label this version as archive/history... ]
    - [Writing/editing short UX text](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/checklists/rewrite-or-edit-short-UX-text.md)
    - [Copy edit checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/checklists/copyedit-checklist.md) [Again, I like the idea of a basic cheat sheet checklist, but the items on this list are outdated and also some are no longer true/contradict new content style rules. So I would def archive/label 'history.']
    - [Proofreading/QA checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/checklists/proofreading-QA-checklist.md) [Some of this is outdated - like not including embedded links within a sentence. Also not sure how useful this is - could use an update and a trim. Conceptually, content proofreading checklist seems helpful, though also maybe redundant of copy edit checklist? ]
    - [UAT process for content migration](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/checklists/UAT-process-for-content-migration.md)
- SEO resources
    - [Writing for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo)
    - [Meta and title tag guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/SEO-work/metas-and-title-tags-guidelines.md) [this is old and overwritten by the guidance in the Writing for SEO section of style guide. can use this anchor link: https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo#meta-properties ]
- GitHub resources
    - [Content process in Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/templates-and-guides/guides/GitHub_content_process.pdf) [this still seems relevant as we have pages still live via GH. but maybe just note that this is partly historical - lots of references to vets.gov ] 
    - [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    - [Github Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# Problems to Solve
- How to add to Formation and design.va.gov
  - https://design.va.gov/documentation/updating-this-site – needs clarification, plus how to add component changes
  - Updating the issue templates to be clearer for new people
  
- [Header Stacks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/patternLibraryInitiatives/headings.md)

- Relationship of aside/sidenav and main element

- Icons, accessible treatment: 
  - Icons need aria-hidden, if they're decorative
  - If they're not decorative and there's semantic meaning — do we have any of these, then we use sr-only — hide the icon, provide the semantic language [https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/other-topics/accessibility#web-fonts-semantic](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/other-topics/accessibility#web-fonts-semantic)
  - File naming convention of the download content, so that users can identify what they've downloaded. For example, VA-017-Brochure-One-Pager-3.2.pdf vs VA-GeneralBenefitsInfo-3.2.pdf.
  - This may be a painstaking effort of scouring the site to uncover where this pattern is coming from that it is implemented like [https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/outreach-materials/](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/outreach-materials/).
  
- 'button' styling without actual _button_ appearance, should follow 'link' styling and include the underline

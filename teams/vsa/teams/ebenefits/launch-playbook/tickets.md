To Release "View my Rated Disabilities"
+ Investigate Pending:
  - if found in `vets-api`, similar to what we have already done

----
For Discovery on "View Dependents":
- Investigate what is in place now for "View Dependents"
  - backend: what data is being shown?
    - technical discovery on previous work
    - locate existing EVSS endpoints
      - consider requesting EVSS service/api updates
  - frontend: consider page structure
    - technical discovery on previous work
  - design: look for new elements, not previously used
    - baseline the workflow, thumbnails, mockups, etc

- Create a Research Plan:
  - learning about Dependent workflows
  - Start modifying the conversation guide
  - User interviews

- Create a Conversation Guide:
  - learning about Dependent workflows from users

- User interviews
  - Use this to better inform how Dependents are approached
  - review and revise the research pland and conversation guide as needed

- Create workflow diagrams
  - existing process
  - potential process (if any)

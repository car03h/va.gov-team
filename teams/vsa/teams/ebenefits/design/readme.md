# eBenefits Migration Design
This directory will house subdirectories for eBenefits screens and features migrating to VA.gov. This is the initial arrangement of materials -- it is a work in progress and will change as the needs of the project becomes clearer. Currently, these subdirectories include:
- Disabilities (Rated Disabilities)
- Dependents

## Introduction
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. My name is Jim (the username on Zoom/GoTo may be different), and with me are a few collegues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our particular focus is the Disability Benefits sections.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take 30 to 40 minutes (Confirm timeframe). But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may break-in to move us to the next item.
- We are not promoting or selling any product or service.
- We're not testing you in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your candid thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Don't worry, I will not be offended by any opinons you express. Please be open about what you think.
- Do you have any questions for me before we start?
- With your permission, I will be recording this session. This will geive a record to use for note-taking. The recording will be store on a private drive--there is no public access. It will be deleted when we conclude our testing , and no personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- Do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Do you have a VA Disability Rating? Can you tell me, generally, about dependents you may have claimed?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov; how often do you visit that site? 
- What differences do you notice between the two sites?
- Why do you visit these sites? (OR) What would you expect to find on them?
- What other sites do you regularly use to learn about or manage VA benefits?
- What computers or phones do you use to access VA (or other) sites? (If no mobile experience) Would you consider using a phone to access VA.gov?
- How has the VA communicated with you in the past? Which of these had links or referenced websites?
- And last, before we look at the test pages, if you wanted to see your VA disability rating, what would you do? This can be online or otherwise: website, phone call, in-person... 
- And how would you find or review your dependents benefits?
- (If no online path indicated) In what circumstances would you try to find this information online?

### Orientation to Screens
OK, now we'll take a look at the link I sent you. Can you share your screen? (If trouble with link) OK, now well look at the pages we're testing; I'll share my screen. Please let me know when you can see it.

What you see is a prototype--it's not a functioning website, it's just a page design right now. But it will have a few working links that we'll click on as we go.

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here.
- Is there anything you'd like to add--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at--or VA.gov in general?
- Would you consider being involved in future follow-up sessions?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to or team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!

# eBenefits Rated Disabilities Research Summary
`James Adams, November 2019`

## Research Purpose & Goals
**Background:** In the course of design and engineering, the current functionality of both Rated Disabilities and View Dependents--basically viewing tabular or listed info from EVSS--was translated to VADS structural elements and components. These screen layouts use two new pieces that were developed to align with a new "tools page" arrangement: a right-hand "help" sidebar, and light grey boxes or "cards" to list formerly tabular information. Missing from this configuration is the left-hand navigational sidebar. Usability testing was conducted to validate the utility of the Rated Disabilities and View Dependents screen individually, and as "Tool Pages."

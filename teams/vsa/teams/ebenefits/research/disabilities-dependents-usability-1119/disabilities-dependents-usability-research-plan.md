## Research Plan for eBenefits Rated Disabilities / View Dependents Usability Testing, November 2019

**Background:** Rated Disabilities and View Dependents are slated to migrate from the eBenefits subdomain to VA.gov. These features (tools, screens) will undergo technical and UI redesign to conform to site IA and the VA.gov Design System (VADS). While the VADS is relatively complete regarding content presentation, the system is not set to easily accommodate tools or application functionality.

During Discovery and Design, the current functionality of both Rated Disabilities and View Dependents--basically viewing tabular or listed info from EVSS--was translated to VADS structural elements and components. These screen layouts use two new pieces that were developed to align with a new "tools page" arrangement: a right-hand "help" sidebar, and light grey boxes or "cards" to list formerly tabular information. Missing from this configuration is the left-hand navigational sidebar.

### Goals
#### Rated Disabilities
- Determine expected baseline usage frequency and utility for the Rated Disabilities screen.
- Determine if Veterans can quickly and easily determine their Total Disabiliy Rating (TDR).
- Assess the utility and readability of "cards" for individual disability ratings.
- Determine if the text presented is clear and helpful to the understanding of the Rated Disabilities information.
- Uncover pain points, user expectations, and potential future features.

#### View Dependents
- Determine expected baseline usage frequency and utility for the Rated Disabilities screen.
- Determine is Veterans can quickly identify their Awarded and Unawarded dependents.
- Assess the utility and readability of "cards" for individual dependents.
- Determine if the text presented is clear and helpful to the understanding of the Dependents information.
- Uncover pain points, user expectations, and potential future features.

#### Tools Page Layout
- Note any usability issues transitioning from legacy ebenefits screens to new VA.gov configurations.
- Uncover the users' expectations for navigating to and away from the screens.
- Determine if Veterans expect a relationship--navigational, informational, etc.--between the Disabilities and Dependents screens.

#### Hypothesis
It is likely the Rated Disabilities and View Dependents screens will test well against their basic function: displaying information. The screen layout and card arrangements will prove adequate, the text will be clear to most users. The lack of sidebar navigation may jar users, who will be inclined to back-button to previous screens. Rated Disabilities will be lightly used by Veterans (who have instant recall of their TDR); View Dependents will be used occasionally when there is a change of status for a dependent, or if investigating a change in benefits payments. Veterans may want disabilities benefits tools/screen to be linked in some way.

#### Guiding Questions
- How often would users access Disabilities and Dependents screens? How would they be prompted to look?
- Can users quickly determine the purpose of the page? Can they find the TRD immediately? Are dependent details immediately apparent?
- Can users immediately find the relevant information on-screen?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text and components)?
- Are the "cards" and acceptable presentation of information?
- Is it clear in the View Dependents screens what the card buttons will do? 
- Given a particular user path, do users have a sense of where they are in the site?
- Is there a clear recourse for users if they see inaccurate or missing information on-screen?
- Do user expect their benefits information to be clumped together?
- What other screens or information would users look for in view-disabilities or view-dependents scenarios?
- Is the navigation into and out of the screens adequate? Did they expect something different?
- What platform do participants use to access VA.gov or other VA sites? Would they consider moible platforms?
- What other features do users expect whe accessing disabilities and dependents information?

#### Success
The this research effort will be successful if it points to a clear verdict regarding the usability of the Rated Disabilities and View Dependents screen--and the underlying tools page template. This does not necessarily mean the layouts and patterns are validated, rather it means there is an actionable path forward to refine these tools for maximum clarity and effectiveness. If significant re-work is required of these screens, further usability testing will follow.

### Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom or GoTo Meeting. Veterans will be presented with high-fidelity prototype created using Adobe XD. A remote moderator will prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

### Participants and Recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 10 Veterans from a range of service backgrounds. Participant criteria include:
- 10 Veterans
- Various service backgrounds
- Georaphically diverse
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
- Because XD prototypes will be presented, there is no support for users needing adaptive equipment or software
- Sessions will run approximately 30 minutes

### Timeline
The target for research session is the week of November 18, 2019. Preparation includes participant recruitment, refining prototypes, writing the conversation guide, and a dry run test session. This plan and the companion Conversation Guide will be finalized by November 12. Target date for the test session is November 13.

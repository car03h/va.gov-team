# Questions for previous 686 Dependents Team
**General Questions**
- What discussions have there been to allow the user modify only the parts they are interested in and possibly submit the form in its entirety in the background?
  - Is it possible to only submit part of the form, for things like updates?
- What does the final validation of the form look like to the user before submission?
- How much user validatoin has been done?
- Did your team consider doing "View" first or why did "Add" get picked up first to go into staging?
  - Was "View" viewed more of a result or destination page to start the process?
- Who can help with DS Login?  Or a point of contact to get started

## Discussion with Andrea Schneider
- Work was done mostly in 2018 over the course of 6 months
- There were some stakeholder blockers: confusion with the form
- unicorns wrapped up in May 2019 after they picked it up
  - Felt like they were 80% there but the next 20% had some unknowns
  - Some questions they had were how to connect it with everything else (View, Modify etc and how to associate it to a claim, apply services to a dependent like education)
  _Associate to a claim is not the same as service connected_
- "Save in progress" helps quite a bit
- After submission, very little is automated actually, a person needs to take a look at it
- Questions about the form itself need to go to the **business owner (?)**
- Order of questions can be loose as long as data gets in 
- In general, logic can be used but it seems that walking through the form is the best course to take
- As far as validatoin goes, A/B test as much as possible and get to staging when you feel close

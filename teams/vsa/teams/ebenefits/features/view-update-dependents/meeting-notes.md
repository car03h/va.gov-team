## Questions for Matt Self, after group orientation
- What discussions have there been to allow the user modify only the parts they are interested in and possibly submit the form in its entirety in the background?
- What does the final validation of the form look like to the user before submission?
- Can the form ever be wrong?
- What can we leverage with logic?
  - What has already been leveraged with logic?
- Did rainbows consider doing "View" first or why did "Add" get picked up first?
  - Was "View" viewed more of a resulting or destination page?
- Is it possible to only submit part of the form, for things like updates?

### **Issue Etiquette**
---
name: User Story Template
about: This is a generic user story template
title: User Story Template for va.gov-teams
labels: ''
assignees: ''

---

## User Story:
As a __________, I need __________ so that I can __________.


## Tasks
_The steps that must be done by the team to complete the acceptance criteria_
- [ ] First thing we need to do - x hour(s) - Owner
- [ ] Second thing we need to do - y hour(s) - Owner
- [ ] Third thing we need to do - z hour(s) - Owner
- [ ] etc

## Acceptance Criteria:
_The requirements that must be met in order to mark this user story as completed_
- [ ] Testable Outcome Y
- [ ] Testable Outcome Z

## Configuration
- [ ] **Attached to a Milestone** (when will this be completed?)
- [ ] **Attached to an Epic** (what body of work is this a part of?)
- [ ] **Labeled with Team** (`product support`, `analytics-insights`, `operations`, `triage`, `tools-improvements`)
- [ ] **Labeled with Practice Area** (`backend`, `frontend`, `devops`, `design`, `research`, `product`, `ia`, `qa`, `analytics`, `call center`, `research`, `accessibility`, `content`)
- [ ] **Labeled with Type** (`bug`, `request`, `discovery`, `documentation`, etc.)
  
All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

### **Estimation**
Estimation is not based on how long something will take to complete, but is rather a combined rating encompassing risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity.

1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly  
2 - Mostly known, doable   
3 - Becoming complex  
5 - Very complex, may take a full sprint or longer  
8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories  

### **Team Norms**

  * Be respectful, both online and off
  * Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
  * Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
  * We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
  * Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.

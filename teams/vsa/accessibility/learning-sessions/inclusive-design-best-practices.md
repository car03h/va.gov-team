_**“I don’t know” is an acceptable answer.**_
Continuous improvement is a tenet of Scrum and Agile: Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently

We’re here to support one another, so it’s okay to not know!

_**“Inclusion is a vast promise — as immense, in fact, as human diversity — and that’s what makes it a great design challenge. But without a clear agreement on what inclusion is, can we ever hope to achieve it? How can we design for something that means so many different things to different people?”**_ 

— Kat Holmes, author of Mismatch, How Inclusion Shapes Design

## What It Is And What It Isn’t

_**Every choice we make ~~as designers~~ determines who can use an environment or product.**_

Every decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society. It’s our collective responsibility to lower these barriers though inclusive products, services, environments, and experiences.

The mismatches that we create in the process are the building blocks of exclusion. 

From the stairs at the entrance of a building to the two-handed design of a video game controller, our solutions clearly signal who does and doesn’t belong.

“Now we look at a small sheet of glass on a sunny day, we juggle our phones one-handed, we’re distracted or in a rush. We are, quite literally, temporarily vision, motor, hearing, and cognitively impaired on a daily basis.” - Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at UK tech charity AbilityNet.

Robin pointed out that without accessibility at the very heart of everything you do, you will be producing websites and apps that leave not only disabled shoppers, but almost every one of your customers, frustrated and keen to take their money elsewhere.

**Inclusive design** focuses on the diversity of people and considers the impact on design decisions.

* Recognize exclusion
* Learn from diversity
* Solve for one, extend to many

Inclusive design: A design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives. Designing inclusively doesn’t mean you’re making one thing for all people. You’re designing a diversity of ways for everyone to participate in an experience with a sense of belonging. Many people are unable to participate in aspects of society, both physical and digital. Understanding why and how people are excluded gives us actionable steps to take towards inclusive design.

The premise of inclusive design is that apart from permanent disabilities there are temporary, situational, or changing disabilities that affect us all. We use mobile devices in noisy environments, we struggle with screen glare in sunlight, and we attempt to tap links on touch screens that are positioned too close to each other—all of which leaves us temporarily impaired.

**Accessibility**
1. The qualities that make an experience open to all. 
2. A professional discipline aimed at achieving No. 1.

An important distinction is that accessibility is an attribute, while inclusive design is a method. And while practicing inclusive design should make your products more accessible, it’s not a process for meeting all accessibility standards. Ideally, accessibility and inclusive design work together to make experiences that are not only compliant with standards, but truly usable and open to all.

Another concept that is closely related to inclusive design is universal design.

**Universal Design** is defined as the design of an environment so that it might be accessed and used in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaptation.

### Inclusive design — what it is & isn’t

Inclusive design, universal design, and accessibility are important for different reasons and have different strengths. 

#### Inclusive design 
* Might not lead to universal designs
* Considers situational impairments, which we all experience on a daily basis
* One-size-fits-one

#### Universal design
* Might not involve the participation of excluded communities 
* One-size-fits-all

**Accessibility** is an attribute, while Inclusive Design and Universal Design are methods. Accessible solutions aren’t always designed to consider human diversity or emotional qualities like beauty or dignity. They simply need to provide access.

Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals. 

Accessibility criteria are the foundation of integrity for any inclusive solution.

Inclusive design, accessibility, and universal design are important for different reasons and have different strengths. Designers should be familiar with all three.

An inclusive designer is someone, arguably anyone, who recognizes and remedies mismatched interactions between people and their world. They seek out the expertise of people who navigate exclusionary designs. The expertise of excluded communities gives insight into a diversity of ways to participate in an experience.

## Why Inclusive Design Matters

_**Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases.**_

**Recognize Exclusion** — Today when we talk about disabilities and related limitations, we include situational impairments, activity limitations, and restrictions on participation. We consider mismatches between individuals and their environments, situations, and society as a whole. [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

For example: For example, a designer assumed a person who is blind wouldn’t use a photocopier. Yet, they might use a photocopier to make copies for others or to copy pages from a book in order to scan them into a speech output program.

This document is to show the amount of issues from IRIS and Salesforce each week.  The breakdown shows the amount of issues that 
were or will be escalated to the appropriate team, the issues that have been resolved, and the issues that are non VA.gov related issues.

There was a backlog of issues that were assigned to the Call Center team earlier this month form an Oracle admin with the earliest being from 6/25/2019.  Breakdown is below.
- 107 total issues (all responded to)
- 83 have been resolved (resolved meaning that it was not a VA.gov technical issue or the Call Center response template has been used)
- 24 are still in progress (in progress meaning that this is an issue that needs to be or has been escalated)

The escaled issues form this particular week are regarding the following:
- Not being able to update their mailing address
- Not being able to upload documents for claims
- Not being able to view their entire claims status or the history.  All information seems to have disappeared.

## SalesForce
Many of the issues reported in SalesForce are the same as the issues from IRIS.  The positive is that they have spoken to a live agent and
have been provided some type of information regarding the issue.  The negative is many of the tickets in SalesForce have been labeled incorrectly by agents
making it difficult to sort through issues.  Another testing report will be created to see if different criteria will assist in this issue.
Communication will be had with the WHVAH leadership in order to indicate that the training that was provided months ago may need to be 
revisited in order for agents to fully understand the importance of labeling tickets accordingly.  Since they may not be able to fully take 
on our issues until March 2020, this issue make take longer to resolve than expected.

# Preface
This document will help all team members working on VA.gov understand how and when it is appropriate to engage the Call Center team for support and provide relevant information to assist in routing reported issues to other appropriate teams.  Because of the limited number of resources on Call Center, they cannot be a "catch-all" for every issue reported on the platform and every application.  Please read the following document carefully in order to determine the appropriate path for your incident.

## IRIS Reporting

VA.gov technical issues are routed to the Call Center IRIS inbox from the Contact Us page on VA.gov.  The goal is to either assign, reassign, or respond within 24 business hours.
* Call Center team will review each issue to determine:
    * If it needs to be escalated to the appropriate team
    * If it should be reassigned to the Call Center that routed it to us
    * If it can be responded to from the response template that has been created
* The Call Center team will only report "trending" issues to the appropriate teams 
    * The Call Center defines a trend as five or more of the same issue.
    
    
## SalesForce Reporting

VA.gov issues are captured by WHH (White House Hotline) agents in SalesForce.  The goal is to either assign, reassign, or respond within 24 business hours.
* Call Center team will review each issue to determine:
  * If it needs to be escalated to the appropriate team
  * If it should be reassigned back to the WHH
  * If it can be responded to from the response temlate that has been created
* The Call Center team will only report "trending" issues to the appropriate teams
    * The Call Center defines a trend as five or more of the same issue.

## Compiling Data
Once the trend has been identified, a spreadsheet will be created by the Call Center team containing:
* Date issue reported
* Ticket number
* Description of issue as stated by the customer
* ALL PII WILL BE REMOVED

## Assigning Issues
Once the data from each source has been entered onto the spreadsheet, copy the information to paste it in a ZH (ZenHub) ticket that will be created.  The criteria for creating a ZH ticket is as follows:
* Issue Title: Brief description of issue
    * Ex. Logon to ID.me error message
* Label: Call Center and any other department that needs research/resolve the issue
* Assignees: All Call Center team members and individuals associated with the team that is researching/resolving the issue.
    * If the Call Center team member is unsure of who the ticket should be assigned to, then it will be assigned to Triage for determination.

## Status Requests
If a Call Center team member has not received an ETA for research or resolution from the appropriate team within 48 business hours, then it is the responsibility of the Call Center team to reach out through ZH to request an update.

## Lack of Communication
If there has been no status update by the end of the 48 business hours, the Call Center team member should escalate the issue to the PM of the team that has been assigned the issue.


Examples:
- va.gov is unresponsive
- Platform errors causing extreme delays for users
- Login to va.gov is unavailable
  
## When to engage the Call Center Team
  
**General Rule:** The Call Center team will make every effort to include ALL pertinent infromation on the issue.  However, if more details are needed
- Find the appropriate ZH ticket relating to the issue
- @ all Call Center team members to be notified 
- Enter in all details or questions concerning the issue
  - Not all customers are fluid in technical terms, please attempt to use layman terminology for best responses
  - Be as detailed as possible to prevent or lessen multiple interactions with the customer which will only cause frustration
- A Call Center team member will reach out to the customer within 24 hours of the request

Examples:
- An internal load testing tool is broken
- Mock data is not working or is out of date
- Metrics are being reported incorrectly or not reported at all
- You are the Global UX team and you learn in research sessions that a lot of Veterans are having trouble accessing their education benefits

**How to Report the Issue:**

Choose one of the following:

* If you know which team the issue should be routed to, reach out to their point of contact to confirm and directly assign the issue to that team.

* If you aren't sure which team owns the issue and would like to send it directly to them without the assistance of Triage, the [Product Owner Mapping Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit?ts=5d28958a#gid=1535759874) can help guide you in the right direction.

* If you aren't sure which team owns the issue and want to send it to Triage team, choose one of the following:

  * Reach out on [`#vsp-triage`](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/CK1FA11H8)

  * Submit a GitHub issue using our [Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2C+triage-incident&template=triage-incident-template.md&title=)

    * _NOTE_: Is there already a GitHub Issue? Add the following labels and post in `#vsp-triage` for visibility:
      * `triage`
      * `triage-incident`
 
_NOTE_: Assigning an issue to Triage using the [Triage Incident Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2C+triage-incident&template=triage-incident-template.md&title=) does not guarantee that the work will be completed by the Triage team.  Triage will do their own investigation, prioritization and scoping to determine the best team responsible for resolution.

## When to NOT engage the Triage Team

* Bugs with products under your team's jurisdiction including endpoints and integrations with APIs
* Feature Improvements that belong within your own team

## Still not sure?

If you still have a doubt about where to report your incident for whatever reason, please reach out to the [`#vsp-triage`](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/CK1FA11H8) Slack channel and we would be happy to assist you.

When in doubt, submit any issue through our [Triage Incident Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage%2C+triage-incident&template=triage-incident-template.md&title=) and the Triage team will ensure it gets through the process correctly!


## What Triage will do with reported issues
### Triage will resolve:
Issues with products/systems that fall under VSP ownership. [See List of Va.gov Products](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit?ts=5d28958a#gid=1535759874) for clarity on which products and systems fall under VSP ownership.

### Triage will route to VFS teams to resolve:
All issues with Veteran-facing Services (including endpoints and integrations with APIs) by assigning a ZenHub issue to the  POC of the VFS team whose product is experiencing issues - per the ownership indicated in the [List of Va.gov Products](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit?ts=5d28958a#gid=1535759874).  

In the event there is no VFS team owner indicated in the [List of Va.gov Products](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit?ts=5d28958a#gid=1535759874) Triage will assign the issue to Chris Johnston.

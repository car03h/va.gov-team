## Key Takeaways

### People feel supported and confident during and immediately after onboarding sessions, but it begins to feel overwhelming when they are on their own.

77% of the responses to the following question positive in nature:

_The content of the kickoff meeting felt..._

> nice & informative.
> perfect to drive next steps
> well structured and organized
> buttery smooth

A few weeks after onboarding, when asked what the biggest challenges were during onboarding, the responses expressed feeling overwhelmed, confused, and lost with the documentation: 

> DELUGE of information, provided in so many different places.
> I received a lot of information in multiple meetings but it was confusing how it all went together. I think the kickoff meeting could have provided more clarity.
> It was all there, but not knowing what a lot of it meant, by the time you need to actually use the information you can't remember where it was located in the documentation.

A few notable responses to the question, "Now that youâ€™ve started working on VA.gov, what were you missing during onboarding that would have made the transition smoother?"

> Honestly, I still feel like I don't have everything I need. I was only able to attend some of the onboarding due to the other project's start. Onboarding to Ad Hoc, the program, and projects all at the same time, there's a tornado of information. Each would benefit from a complete onboarding document, but I also recognize the challenges.
> Deeper dives to include more GitHub and pull requests training.
> A simple list of the tasks we were asked to do showing why and where it fit in to the big picture. Documentation was thorough and very helpful if you could find it. It was very difficult to find the documentation you were looking for in Git.

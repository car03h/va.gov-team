## When, How, and Why to Engage Platform

### Why?
- ATO
- Security/Architecture Review/Consulting 
- Load testing
- Configurations
- Establishing connections to backend systems 
- Beta launch support/rollout strategy

### When?
- *During product discovery* when you think you know about the data/services/product direction
  - Are you connecting to any external system?
  - Are you collecting or using any veteran data?
- *End of discovery* to confirm original direction
- *During technical discovery*
	- What are data storage needs?
	- What are the different API interactions?
	- What kind of capacity do you require?
	- What is the data exposure?
- *About two weeks before launch* (or earlier, team leads exercise judgement about when to bring Platform in for complex projects)

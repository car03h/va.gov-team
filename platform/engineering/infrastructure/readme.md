# Previous Readme Content From Deprecated 'Work Practices' Folder
The Vets.gov DevOps team has gone by both "DevOps" and "Platform" over time. You may find references to either in GitHub. While we do our best to update them all, some references can get missed. This team was renamed back to "DevOps" to avoid name conflicts with the [Digital Services Platform project at the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-digital-services-platform-docs) (aka Lighthouse).

<summary>DevOps Onboarding</summary>

## DevOps Onboarding

Welcome to the team! If all has gone well, you've made it through our [main onboarding section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/wiki/Onboarding) and you're ready to start work with the DevOps teem. This should help you get started. 

Resources from the sprint teams will work with the DevOps team regularly to encourage further cross-product communication. In onboarding, find out what we do, our history, our responsibilities, and who the people are who share those responsibilities.

[Get started on the DevOps team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Practice%20Areas/Engineering/Infrastructure/Onboarding.md).

<summary>Scope</summary>

## Scope

DevOps provides development and maintenance resources with a focus on establishing reusable libraries, patterns, and processes for use across the Vets.gov project. Efforts may span the entirety of the project stack, including documentation, design, frontend, backend, supporting services, process, and infrastructure.

This team should be consulted on new application sprint team developments, but will not monopolize development of cross-product features. Rather, they are responsible for helping these teams build those features as reusable, maintainable components.

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>History</summary>

## History

The DevOps team originally provided infrastructure and deployment processes for the Vets.gov project. The DSVA maintained a separate team to build similar components for Appeals. Both projects continued to develop separate infrastructure and utilities to better support application development. Frequent dialog between the teams led to the utilization of similar technologies, but implementation details differed.

An effort to reduce the duplication of work and take advantage of the common technology stack led to the development of a framework capable of providing a common set of tools and provisioning with the ability to customize as needed for each project. This work, resulting in the ability to solve common problems faced by both teams, led to the creation of the DSVA SRE team. This new team breaks down silos between the Appeals and Vets.gov teams, and provides the opportunity to further scale resources and services into additional DSVA projects and ultimately to the VA. For more information, see the [SRE Team design rationale](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/docs/SRETeam.md). 

DevOps historically contributed to a common technology stack across the Vets.gov application stack as well. The team developed common monitoring, logging, exception tracking systems, and assisted with the integration of basic resilience patterns. Contributions to documentation and process helped formalize requirements for code review and incident response. 

This team continues to break down silos between sprint teams by reimplementing the pattern that led to the DSVA SRE team.

<summary>Sprint Rotations</summary>

## Rotations

To encourage cross-team collaboration and to ensure usability and applicability of Platform product contributions, we will pull resources from Kudos, Rainbows, Nebula, or Unicorns for single sprint rotations. 

During their rotation, team members will ideally work on a platform feature that is relevant to their sprint team or that they have some relevant background/context on. They will also spend some time working on core DevOps tasks in order to disseminate expertise on how Vets.gov is operated. The rotation schedule should be determined during Program Increment (PI) planning.

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>DevOps Ambassadors</summary>

## Ambassadors

To encourage the continued application of processes and experience from DevOps team rotations, a member of each team will become the DevOps Ambassador. They are responsible for maintaining familiarity with DevOps projects/developments, and ensuring that DevOps is updated with major feature/process developments on their team.

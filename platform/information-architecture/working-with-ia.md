# Working with IA - Rules of Engagement (ROE)
This document will help all teams working on VA.gov understand when you should engage IA resources for collaboration and support.
All teams building on the Veteran Services Platform should follow VA.gov IA best practices and guidelines and work with an IA resource to ensure all content is easily findable and we maintain a consistent navigation experience across the site.

## <a id="whatdoesIAdo"></a>What does IA do?
>*”Information Architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content…The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks.“* - Usability.gov

**There are 2 primary focus areas of IA on VSP**
1. **Site IA** = The overall structure and organization of all content and tools on VA.gov. The structure impacts content design, page flow, URLs, labeling and SEO. We also ensure proper redirects and/or vanity URLs are in place as the structure evolves. 

2. **Navigation Design** = The flow, labeling and experience of all navigation elements and the identification of primary entry points and key cross-linking opportunities.  This includes top and left navigation components, home and hub page links, the breadcrumb, footer links, related link components, inline content links, etc.  

**When can IA help?**
- Launching a new content page (or several) on VA.gov
- Launching a new tool on VA.gov
- Rewriting content and need to split or merge existing content pages
- Looking to improve findability of an existing page or tool
- Taking down a content page and/or tool
- Changing the UX of navigational elements (i.e. top nav, left nav, breadcrumbs)

## <a id="whentorequest"></a>When to request IA resources
It is beneficial to engage IA resources as early as possible when you begin work on a page, product or tool and collaborate throughout your project, as many things can impact and evolve IA and navigation.  Involving an IA resource earlier in your project will help avoid structural changes down the line. 

**At project kick-off** 
- It is beneficial to engage IA resources as early as possible in your work so we can gather background information, understand scope and timing, and determine how to work together through your project. 

**When planning user research** 
- We will review discussion guides and prototypes for navigation design and labeling, and look at how findability of your content/tool can be included as part of your research. 
- If the research is highly focused on findability, flow and navigation, we ask that you please include us in the sessions as well.  
- Include us in research readouts so we can evolve your appropriately based on your findings.

**To review designs and/or prototypes** 
- We will provide feedback on navigational elements of designs and prototypes, especially if they will be used in user research. 

**To review draft content** 
- IA and writing need to work together, and as content evolves, it can impact the IA.  Content elements are also used to determine pages names/URLs. 
- If your project includes multiple content pages or complex content, we ask that you work with us during the writing process.  We will provide feedback on how structuring content impacts IA. 

**Before development** 
- We will provide final URLs, navigation labels (in collaboration with content), link placement, redirect needs, XML sitemap direction, and any other documentation for your development team.  

Outside of these time periods, IA resources can be requested any time a team thinks they could benefit from collaboration or review.


## <a id="howtorequest"></a>How to request IA support

# Current Ruby & Rails Versioning:

## vets-api:

`vets-api` depends on `ruby` and `rails`

We aim to keep our `ruby` language dependency as close to the latest [stable version](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) available. 

We aim to keep our `rails` framework dependency as close to the latest [stable version](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases) available.

Current dependency versions can be found in our [Gemfile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/Gemfile)

We may not always be at the latest major versions but we will make every effort to plan and implement incremental updates immediately upon release. 

## Security Patches
If a security patch is released, we will prioritize work to update to the patched version immediately.

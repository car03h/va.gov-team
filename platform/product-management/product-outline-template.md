## Background
DEPO, working in coordination with VBA, began an ambitious project to modernize the VA's digital benefits delivery process. Practically, this is taking the form of a migration of functionality from the current platform, eBenefits (http://www.ebenefits.va.gov), to the modern web platform of the future, VA.gov (http://www.va.gov).

For each feature on the eBenefits platform, an analysis is being done to determine the appropriate path forward for the feature; essentially, we will determine to move, redesign, or retire each of the eBenefits features until every feature on the platform has been accounted for.

BAM2 decided to pick a self-contained, low-hanging fruit from the list of eBenefits priorities(xxx), and use it as a low-risk way familiarize our team with VA.gov, the stack, and the way DEPO works, while also delivering actual value to users. With that in mind, with input from Steve Kovacs who is leading the eBenefits Modernization project, we decided on the online oerdreing service Veteran's use to order hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks.

We have heard anecdotally that this feature has an "extremely high" usage rate; this seems to make sense, as hearing loss is often irreversible, with hearing aids requiring a constant supply of batteries.

Following up on hearing aids. It looks like the data is in VistA and that there is a Mumps package for accessing it.  Some folks at the Loma Linda VA medical center, who built VEText, are willing to build an API to it, if that would be valuable to VA.gov.  If it would be, let me know who the best point of contact would be and happy to either connect folks and get out of it, or stay involved and help facilitate (whichever is most helpful to the team)!

The MVPs of the My VA dashboard, Profile, and Account page launched in the spring of 2018. In June 2019, the Personalization team decided to revisit these products to evaluate what was going well and what could be improved, removed, added, or reorganized.

Discovery Goals
Evaluate the My VA dashboard, its utility, and its relationship to the VA.gov homepage.
Determine whether we should combine the Profile and Account pages.
Determine whether we should combine My VA into one mega section with Profile and Account.
Understand how the service member experience differs from the veteran experience, and how this may affect our work.

## Assumptions

## Questions
- Who "owns" the Medical device ordering "portfolio"?
- We've heard that hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks are available, what else is offered? Data on the volume/timing of orders for each available product?
- How are orders processed? How long does processing take? How is the order fulfilled? Order received on paper vs. eBenefits?
- What issues do Veterans encounter trying to use the eBenefits ordering form?
- What is https://hearing.health.mil/For-Providers/DoD-VA-Hearing-Prosthetics-Ordering-System? How does it fit? Who uses it? Audiologists? Veterans? Both?
- The page above references Audiologists, but includes a link to https://www.va.gov/eauth/roes/, which seems to target Veterans; what's the difference between the pages/systems/processes?
- Heard there may be an API; what's the story there?
- Tell us about VEText; how does it fit in?
- How can we get access to a non-production instance of the tool on eBenefits?

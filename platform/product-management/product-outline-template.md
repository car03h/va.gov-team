## The Problem
Following up on hearing aids. It looks like the data is in VistA and that there is a Mumps package for accessing it.  Some folks at the Loma Linda VA medical center, who built VEText, are willing to build an API to it, if that would be valuable to VA.gov.  If it would be, let me know who the best point of contact would be and happy to either connect folks and get out of it, or stay involved and help facilitate (whichever is most helpful to the team)!
 

### User Goals


### Business Goals


## Assumptions

## Questions
- Who "owns" the Medical device ordering "portfolio"?
- We've heard that hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks are available, what else is offered? Data on the volume/timing of orders for each available product?
- How are orders processed? How long does processing take? How is the order fulfilled? Order received on paper vs. eBenefits?
- What issues do Veterans encounter trying to use the eBenefits ordering form?
- What is https://hearing.health.mil/For-Providers/DoD-VA-Hearing-Prosthetics-Ordering-System? How does it fit? Who uses it? Audiologists? Veterans? Both?
- The page above references Audiologists, but includes a link to https://www.va.gov/eauth/roes/, which seems to target Veterans; what's the difference between the pages/systems/processes?
- Heard there may be an API; what's the story there?
- Tell us about VEText; how does it fit in?
- How can we get access to a non-production instance of the tool on eBenefits?

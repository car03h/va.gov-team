## Welcome to Google Analytics

VA.gov uses the paid tier for Google Analytics, called Google Analytics 360 or GA 360. The premium versions offers a higher tier of data collection and more customizable traits that we can use to measure success. 

The Admins for the VSP Analytics-Insights Team are Joanne Esteban, Nedie Recel, and Jon Wehausen.
